He has blue eyes and chestnut hair which tends to be a frazzled mess, spiking upwards. He has a wide mustache and a trimmed goatee.</p><p>Gimble usually wears relatively simple clothing, similar to the short robe customary to his duties as a librarian in his hometown.</p><h4 id=personality>Personality</h4><p>Gimble usually tries to do good (as he sees it), but often the realities of adventuring do not leave easy choices. Since Gimble has a very cautious nature and is prone to overthinking options, this can lead to inaction. However, he will do what is necessary to help those in need.</p><p>The time in <a href=/dnd/locations/avernus>Avernus</a> left a mark on Gimble. He has been fighting with paranoia and has a persistent nervous twitch in his left hand.</p><h3 id=biography>Biography</h3><h4 id=background>Background</h4><p>Gimble seeks to unravel the mystery of a strange, blank book and its connection to his lost sister.</p><p><a href=/dnd/characters/gimble/gimble-the-diviner-backstory>Gimble the Diviner Backstory</a></p><h4 id=the-phandalin-affair>The Phandalin Affair</h4><ul><li>The first meetings of the party.</li><li>Gimble tells the party to save themselves as he is left behind at Cragmaw Castle, hiding from the resident hobgoblins.</li><li>Gimble negligently causes a vast wildfire while trying to defend the party from a pack of gnolls using a <em>Flaming Sphere</em>.</li><li>Gimble provokes a large battle with <a href=/dnd/npcs/iarno-albrek>Iarno Albrek</a> and The Redbrands, which leads to a tense standoff and <a href=/dnd/characters/haeltin-var-astora>Gray</a>&rsquo;s (first) death.</li></ul><h4 id=mount-hotenow-katabasis>Mount Hotenow Katabasis</h4><ul><li>Gimble feels a bit useless during the party&rsquo;s first encounter with devils as his combat spells were largely fire-based.</li></ul><h4 id=journeys-in-the-feywild>Journeys in the Feywild</h4><ul><li>Gimble acquires a favor from <a href=/dnd/npcs/caerwyn-cadogan>Caerwyn Cadogan</a>, valid for a year and a day.</li><li>On advice from Caerwyn, Gimble learns the faerie verse of pleasant disengagement, &ldquo;Beneath the sun or falling rain, I yield to thee thy path again.&rdquo;<ul><li>This never proves useful.</li></ul></li><li>Gimble trades spell scrolls with a paper drake for several magic items for the party, including <a href=/dnd/characters/val>Val</a>&rsquo;s <em>Wand of Wonder</em>.</li><li>Gimble gives away a secret (one of his daily portents) in exchange for admittance to the Court of Stars</li><li>When Caerwyn repays Gimble&rsquo;s favor and sets the party free from the oubliettes, Caerwyn gives him a small box. Opening it later, the party finds a fabric made of shadow, which unfurled to reveal itself as a <em>Portable Hole</em>. Inside the hole, the party finds the dagger used to strike <a href=/dnd/npcs/queen-titania>Queen Titania</a>.</li></ul><h4 id=downtime-at-the-manor>Downtime at the Manor</h4><ul><li>Gimble trains in alchemist supplies.</li><li>Gimble collaborates with <a href=/dnd/characters/oneshoe>Oneshoe</a> to build a 7-foot tall clockwork dragon.</li><li>Gimble studies magic.</li><li>Gimble gives in to Val&rsquo;s demands and relinquishes the <em>Portable Hole</em>.</li></ul><h4 id=the-great-modron-march>The Great Modron March</h4><ul><li>Gimble starts to see strange geometric shapes in his book, which foretell the coming of the Modrons.</li><li>Gimble foresees a chance for Gray to deceive the leader of the Modrons into diverting the course of the march and saving the town of Phandalin.</li></ul><h4 id=welcome-to-leilon>Welcome to Leilon</h4><ul><li>Gimble is briefly lost and alone in the Shadowfell.</li><li>Gimble meets The Grammarian.</li><li>Gimble acquires the <em>Ring of the Grammarian</em>.</li><li>Gimble attempts to end the suffering of the wife of Harold Peters (you know, <a href=/dnd/npcs/the-tinkerer>The Tinkerer</a>) with a casting of <em>GentleR Repose</em> using the power of the Grammarian.</li><li>Gimble breaks the ancient seal in pursuit of his sister.</li><li>Gimble finds his Aunt Lyra and sister <a href=/dnd/npcs/nyx>Nyx</a> encased in crystal in the depths of the aboleth&rsquo;s lair.</li><li>Nyx seemingly warps reality to save Gimble from a critical blow from the aboleth.</li><li>Gimble is faced with the <a href=/dnd/characters/gimble/dilemma-at-the-aboleths-lair>Dilemma at the Aboleth&rsquo;s Lair</a> and opts to save Val first, counting on <a href=/dnd/characters/horns>Horns</a> to save his family from drowning.</li></ul><h4 id=a-hellish-tale>A Hellish Tale</h4><ul><li>Gimble uses a <em>Wall of Force</em> to dramatically end a chase scene on the planes of Avernus.</li><li>Eventually, <a href=/dnd/characters/gimble/gimble-became-lawful-evil-in-avernus/>Gimble Became Lawful Evil in Avernus</a>. He chooses to leave the party and banish himself back to the Material Plane. <sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup></li><li>Before he leaves, <a href=/dnd/characters/gimble/gimble-prepares-special-defensive-magic-for-finn/>Gimble prepares special defensive magic for Finn</a>.</li></ul><h4 id=paranoid-and-reclusive>Paranoid and Reclusive</h4><p>A returned, evil Gimble grew paranoid and holed up for a time, building his power and defenses. Later, connecting with his sister Nyx allowed him to find his way back to himself, but he was unable to contact the party directly. Instead, a cryptic divination led Gimble to Gorstag as a means to send help to the party via a messenger. Then, a sudden event forces Gimble to make a hasty exit.</p><h4 id=on-the-run-with-nyx>On the Run with Nyx</h4><p>Gimble and Nyx spend some time on the road and have at least one close call evading their pursuers. Along the way, Gimble attempts to get his sister to open up about the mystery of her past and the forces chasing them, but each time she shuts him out.</p><h4 id=reunited-with-the-party>Reunited with the Party</h4><p>Shortly after the party was attacked by <a href=/dnd/npcs/the-revenant>The Revenant</a> at Tresendar Manor <sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup>, Gimble receives a portent that Finn is in danger and seeking his help. After scrying on their location, Gimble teleports to Phandalin to assess the situation, and finds things are not quite as they had seemed. After an awkward reunion, Gimble relates the challenges he has been facing and almost seems to collapse under the stress before he declares that he is &ldquo;tired of running.&rdquo; He declares his intent to seek out and confront the dangers they face. And he asks if the party wishes to join him.</p><h3 id=relationships>Relationships</h3><h4 id=finn-the-conjurer>Finn the Conjurer</h4><p>Early in the campaign, Gimble and <a href=/dnd/characters/finn>Finn</a> became friends. Curious at first, he was soon drawn in by her cheerful nature, and happily aided Finn with her studies in simple magic. Over time, Gimble developed more affection for Finn and showed signs that he wanted to help protect her from the fallout of the party&rsquo;s often (in his view) questionable decisions.</p><p>When <a href=/dnd/characters/gimble/gimble-became-lawful-evil-in-avernus>Gimble Became Lawful Evil in Avernus</a>, he knew he had to escape the hellish plane and would no longer wait for the party to come to their senses. Still, his friendship with Finn made him waver. Gimble first made some <a href=/dnd/characters/gimble/gimble-prepares-special-defensive-magic-for-finn>special castings</a> into his <em>Ioun stone</em> and gave it to Finn, hoping it would help keep her safe. When Gimble finally confronted the party with his need to leave, he paused for a moment, saying &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Finn,&rdquo; before
banishing himself from the plane.</p><h4 id=gray>Gray</h4><p>Gimble respects <a href=/dnd/characters/haeltin-var-astora/>Gray</a>. At several points, Gray and Gimble have entrusted each other to do the right thing when they couldn&rsquo;t fully trust themselves to do so. Gray asked Gimble to put him down if he ever lost control and attacked the party. Gimble entrusted Gray with the keeping of the <em>Plane Shift</em> scroll when he foresaw the possibility of <a href=/dnd/characters/gimble/gimble-became-lawful-evil-in-avernus/>being corrupted in Avernus</a>.</p><p>Gimble has also felt indebted to Gray for his sacrifices on behalf of Gimble in Leilon.</p><h4 id=horns>Horns</h4><p>Gimble is often befuddled by <a href=/dnd/characters/horns>Horns</a>.</p><h4 id=oneshoe>OneShoe</h4><p>Gimble is friends with <a href=/dnd/characters/oneshoe>Oneshoe</a>. He admires her cunning and intelligence.</p><p>During the reconstruction of <a href=/dnd/locations/tresendar-manor>Tresendar Manor</a>, the two gnomes enjoyed collaborating on the construction of a seven-foot-tall clockwork dragon.</p><p>After OneShoe had some difficulty during a fight with a witch, Gimble gave his <em>Necklace of Fireballs and Force</em> to OneShoe so that she would have more tools in future fights.</p><p>When Gimble sent a letter to the party in <a href=/dnd/locations/phlegethos>Phlegethos</a>, he counted on Oneshoe&rsquo;s intellect to handle future coded messages.</p><h4 id=rinnthalas>Rinn&rsquo;thalas</h4><p>Gimble secretly arranged for <a href=/dnd/characters/rinnthalas-liadon>Rinn&rsquo;thalas</a> to find and deliver a message to the party in the Hells. Gimble pulled in a favor with <a href=/dnd/characters/gorstag>Gorstag</a> to accomplish this. Rinn&rsquo;thalas is not aware of Gimble&rsquo;s involvement.</p><h4 id=val>Val</h4><p>Gimble currently fears and distrusts <a href=/dnd/characters/val>Val</a>.</p><p>Early in the campaign, Gimble and Val were friendly, but their relationship soon became strained. After her rescue from captivity from the Orcs at Wyvern Tor, Val started displaying more impulsive and violent behavior which often put the party at risk. At times, her actions were straight evil, and to Gimble&rsquo;s consternation, the party usually tacitly allowed or even outright defended Val&rsquo;s actions.</p><p>Then there was <a href=/dnd/characters/gimble/that-time-val-tried-to-murder-gimble>That time Val tried to murder Gimble</a>.</p><p>And yet, despite the above, Gimble felt compelled to save Val first instead of his newly-found family during the <a href=/dnd/characters/gimble/dilemma-at-the-aboleths-lair>Dilemma at the Aboleth&rsquo;s Lair</a>. This choice later weighed upon him heavily.</p><p>When <a href=/dnd/characters/gimble/gimble-became-lawful-evil-in-avernus>Gimble Became Lawful Evil in Avernus</a>, he was released from any latent feeling of obligation or camaraderie towards Val.</p><h4 id=zed>Zed</h4><p>Gimble is friendly with <a href=/dnd/characters/zed>Zed</a> and has found him to be a trusted companion; however, part of Gimble still finds the paladin a bit of a mystery and remains somewhat wary of him.</p><p>A study in contrasts, Zed&rsquo;s massive size and physical prowess alone would intimidate most any folk of Gimble&rsquo;s stature. Yet, Zed also possesses a gentle nature and forthrightness which mostly allay those fears. However, when Gimble was preyed on by a Night Hag in the Feydark, the creature tormented Gimble with visions of a nightmarish Zed slaughtering the party. Though the hag and her nightmares are no more, and, rationally, Gimble has dismissed the visions as merely cruel tricks of the mind, he hasn&rsquo;t quite been able to shake the dread from that incident.</p><p>This certainly hasn&rsquo;t been helped by the trip to Avernus, during which Zed gleefully rode astride a giant, <em>Nightmare</em>-form of Bullwinkle.</p><h3 id=character-information>Character Information</h3><h4 id=quests>Quests</h4><ul><li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> Locate his traveling Aunt Lyra</li><li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> Find his missing sister</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Solve the riddle of his village&rsquo;s denial of Nyx&rsquo;s existence</li><li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> Identify and stop the force pursuing Nyx</li></ul><h4 id=notable-items>Notable Items</h4><ul><li><em>Heward&rsquo;s Handy Haversack</em></li><li><em>Inscriptor</em></li><li><em>Ring of the Grammarian</em></li><li><em>Ring of Protection</em></li><li><em>Spider Staff</em> (acquired from <a href=/dnd/npcs/nezznar-the-black-spider>Nezznar, The Black Spider</a>)</li></ul><h4 id=former-items>Former Items</h4><ul><li><em>Ioun Stone of Reserve</em><ul><li>filled with <a href=/dnd/characters/gimble/gimble-prepares-special-defensive-magic-for-finn>special castings of defensive spells</a> and given to <a href=/dnd/characters/finn>Finn</a> in Avernus.</li></ul></li><li><em>Necklace of Fireballs and Force</em><ul><li>given to <a href=/dnd/characters/oneshoe>Oneshoe</a> after the battle with the witch.</li></ul></li><li><em>Portable Hole</em><ul><li>given to <a href=/dnd/characters/val>Val</a> after she demanded it at Tresendar Manor.</li></ul></li></ul><h4 id=abilities>Abilities</h4><h3 id=quotations>Quotations</h3><ul><li><a href=/dnd/characters/gimble-the-diviner>Gimble</a>: &ldquo;The sky is gray and tinged with regret.&rdquo; (Gimble reflecting upon the ashen sky after fleeing a wildfire he had caused.)</li><li>Gimble: &ldquo;You did what?!&rdquo; (Gimble reacting to the party&rsquo;s shenanigans)</li><li>Gimble: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Finn.&rdquo; (Gimble&rsquo;s last words to the party at Avernus)</li></ul><h3 id=trivia>Trivia</h3><ul><li>Someone looking over his shoulder as Gimble reads the book each morning would see nothing on its pages.</li></ul><h3 id=references>References</h3><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>See: <a href=https://tlake.io/dnd/posts/2020/09/05/catch-22-items/>2020-09-05 Import Campaign</a>&#160;<a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:2><p>See: <a href=https://tlake.io/dnd/posts/2023/03/15/a-terrible-anniversary/#undead-assault-tresendar-manor>2023-03-15 Import Campaign</a>&#160;<a href=#fnref:2 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li></ol></div><ul class=pa0><li class="list di"><a href=/tags/my/dnd/campaigns/import_campaign/characters/gimble/ class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">My/DND/Campaigns/Import_campaign/Characters/Gimble</a></li></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"><div class="bg-light-gray pa3 nested-list-reset nested-copy-line-height nested-links"><p class="f5 b mb3">Related</p><ul class="pa0 list"><li class=mb2><a href=/dnd/characters/gimble/dilemma-at-the-aboleths-lair/>Dilemma at the Aboleth's Lair</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/dnd/characters/gimble/gimble-became-lawful-evil-in-avernus/>Gimble Became Lawful Evil in Avernus</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/dnd/characters/gimble/gimble-prepares-special-defensive-magic-for-finn/>Gimble prepares special defensive magic for Finn</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/dnd/characters/gimble/gimble-the-diviner-backstory/>Gimble the Diviner Backstory</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/dnd/characters/gimble/that-time-val-tried-to-murder-gimble/>That time Val tried to murder Gimble</a></li></ul></div></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://tlake.io/>&copy; Tanner Lake 2024</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
