His father, Dimble, was a member of the Gemcutters Guild and possessed a whimsical spirit. Gimble&rsquo;s mother, Nyssa, on the other hand, took her job as the local tinker quite seriously, as she did most things.</p><p>They lived together in the central part of town, near the general store. Gimble had no siblings.</p><p>† Names cut for space</p><h4 id=a-strange-turn>A strange turn</h4><p>One day, while his parents were out, Gimble was doing chores, and he happened upon a piece of paper which had fallen behind a bookshelf. It turned out to be an old letter from his Aunt Lyra, who had moved away before he was born. Gimble had always liked hearing his mother&rsquo;s stories about his aunt and her travels. Everyone else he knew seemed content living their lives within the village.</p><p>The letter seemed normal enough at first, describing the town Aunt Lyra had been staying in and her plans of moving on to explore another settlement. There was an amusing story of some local scandal as well as a recommendation for the only dish in the tavern that might befit a gnomish palette.</p><p>Then, there it was. In the closing, Aunt Lyra had sent her love to Gimble&rsquo;s mother and family. She had also written that she hoped little Gimble was growing up to be a good playmate for his big sister.</p><p>Confused, Gimble dropped the letter on the bookshelf and went to find his parents, who were at the tavern. He asked them about having a sister, but his father laughed and dismissed the idea, thinking he was joking. When they realized Gimble was serious, his mother just told him that he was being ridiculous. Gimble stormed home, determined to show them the letter, but found it was no longer where he had left it.</p><h4 id=pursuit-of-answers>Pursuit of answers</h4><p>Despite his parents&rsquo; assurances, Gimble was unable to forget what he had read. He started to ask around town, but no one seemed to know anything about him ever having a sister. When Gimble persisted, others started to think him peculiar or even begin to doubt his sanity. Sensing this, Gimble decided to continue his own research in secret, taking an apprenticeship at the town library, much to the chagrin of the librarian&rsquo;s own son, who had thought he would have been awarded the post.</p><p>Over years, Gimble consumed the stacks in hope of learning something about the missing sister, but he was unable find any evidence. He, too, began to doubt himself at times.</p><h4 id=pushing-boundaries>Pushing boundaries</h4><p>Eventually exhausting most of the library&rsquo;s open resources, Gimble decided to sneak in at night and explore the restricted sections, which Master Orrenth, the librarian, had forbidden him to enter. Here he found a dusty spellbook and worked out the beginnings of magic, first focusing on how to remain hidden so that he might continue searching the dark corners of the library unnoticed by the either the librarian or his son, who constantly searched for a reason to have Gimble thrown out.</p><h4 id=a-mysterious-book>A mysterious book</h4><p>At some point Gimble came a across a strange book he had never seen before. On the highest shelf, wedged between two larger tomes, was a slim, pale volume, unadorned with any title or marking. Gimble crept up a ladder and placed his hand on the book.</p><p>And suddenly, he felt a shock go up his arm, and Gimble began to fall backwards. In that moment, Gimble saw a clear image, a memory of his sister pulling him by the hand through the market. He heard himself saying &ldquo;Slow down, Nyx!&rdquo;</p><p>Gimble&rsquo;s vision returned to find himself and the ladder smashing against the set of stacks behind him. Though the impact knocked the wind out of him, he felt like he was still falling. No, the stacks, themselves, were falling. First one, and then the next, until half the library was in shambles. For a moment, the noise was nearly deafening, and then silence.</p><p>And then laughter. Gimble looked up to see Roen, the librarian&rsquo;s son, with a crooked smile on his lips. &ldquo;Oh, you are in for it!&rdquo; he said.</p><p>Gimble ran.</p><p>He ran through the remains of the library, leaving illusions behind him. He ran out into the night, avoiding his pursuer. He ran, but found he could not run home.</p><p>Gimble left the village that night.</p><hr><h4 id=before-joining-the-party>Before joining the party</h4><p>Gimble travelled a bit, earning his way as a tinker or scholar when needed. Hoping for clues about his sister, he searched for his aunt in a few locations without much success.</p><p>He spent much of his time examining the book. It was a curious thing. Devoid of any decoration or letters, the book would not allow any new mark to be made upon itself. Neither ink, chalk, nor graphite would take to the pages.</p><p>Eventually landing in Neverwinter, Gimble caught a rumor of his Aunt having travelled through there on the way to Phandalin, so he decided to make his way there. It seemed that a dwarf was hiring an escort for a small caravan to the town&mldr;</p><h4 id=after-joining-the-party>After joining the party</h4><p>Though somewhat distracted from his own quest by the affairs in Phandalin, Gimble still started each day looking through the book, hoping to trigger another memory of his sister or somehow derive some meaning by peering even more closely at the blank pages.</p><p>One day, the pages were no longer blank.</p><p>For a brief moment, words appeared. The words made no sense, for they described events of which Gimble had no memory, even though he often played a part in them. Then, suddenly, the words and the images they painted were gone, and Gimble could only hold onto fragments.</p><p>Those fragments later came to pass.</p><p>And so have the others which have appeared each morning since.</p><blockquote><h5 id=what-gimble-knows>What Gimble Knows</h5><ul><li>A letter from his Aunt Lyra claimed he has an older sister.</li><li>His parents and the village say he does not.</li><li>The parents and the villagers seem to be sincere and not of ill intent.</li><li>The book triggered a memory of his sister, &ldquo;Nyx&rdquo;.</li></ul></blockquote><blockquote><h5 id=what-gimble-doesnt-know>What Gimble Doesn&rsquo;t Know</h5><ul><li>He does, in fact, have a sister.</li><li>His divination ability was triggered by the book, but it is not depedent upon it.</li><li>Someone looking over his shoulder as Gimble reads the book each morning would see nothing on its pages.</li></ul></blockquote><blockquote><h5 id=what-only-the-dm-knows>What Only the DM Knows</h5><ul><li>How to reconcile the above.</li><li>What happened to the letter.</li><li>What happened to the sister.</li><li>What happened to his aunt.</li><li>The full meaning of the book.</li></ul></blockquote><ul class=pa0><li class="list di"><a href=/tags/my/dnd/campaigns/import_campaign/characters/gimble/ class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">My/DND/Campaigns/Import_campaign/Characters/Gimble</a></li></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"><div class="bg-light-gray pa3 nested-list-reset nested-copy-line-height nested-links"><p class="f5 b mb3">Related</p><ul class="pa0 list"><li class=mb2><a href=/dnd/characters/gimble/dilemma-at-the-aboleths-lair/>Dilemma at the Aboleth's Lair</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/dnd/characters/gimble/gimble-became-lawful-evil-in-avernus/>Gimble Became Lawful Evil in Avernus</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/dnd/characters/gimble/gimble-prepares-special-defensive-magic-for-finn/>Gimble prepares special defensive magic for Finn</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/dnd/characters/gimble-the-diviner/>Gimble the Diviner</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/dnd/characters/gimble/that-time-val-tried-to-murder-gimble/>That time Val tried to murder Gimble</a></li></ul></div></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://tlake.io/>&copy; Tanner Lake 2024</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
