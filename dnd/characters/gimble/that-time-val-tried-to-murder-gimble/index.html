That time Val tried to murder Gimble When the party became 5th level, Gimble had a premonition that he would very soon need the ability to fly. Obsessed with this, he absentmindedly plucked a feather from Val&rsquo;s new Giant Owl form for a spell component to aid in his furious study. Although he did not notice at first, Val was enraged.
When the party took flight on the backs of the druids&rsquo; new flying forms, Val decided to try to murder Gimble by knocking him off Owl-Horns&rsquo; back mid-flight."><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.126.1"><meta name=robots content="index, follow"><link rel=stylesheet href=/ananke/css/main.min.2438bcafd7af9675c426d1a4afcd16cfff18e4e10f401071e45b5ccd3be40a0d.css><link rel=canonical href=https://tlake.io/dnd/characters/gimble/that-time-val-tried-to-murder-gimble/><meta property="og:url" content="https://tlake.io/dnd/characters/gimble/that-time-val-tried-to-murder-gimble/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="tlake.io"><meta property="og:title" content="That time Val tried to murder Gimble"><meta property="og:description" content="Gimble the Diviner
