Each hex is roughly 25 miles, so 16 * 25 = 400 miles.</p><p>Total distance as a ship would sail, following the coastline: ≈ 2000 miles.</p><p>A <em>sailing ship</em> travels 120 miles per day: 2000 ÷ 120 = 16 2/3 days ≈ <strong>17 days</strong>.</p><h2 id=by-wind-walk>By <em>Wind Walk</em></h2><p>The DMG actually has a <a href=https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/running-the-game#SpecialTravelPace>section on special travel paces</a>:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Special Travel Pace</strong></p><p>The rules on travel pace in the Player’s Handbook assume that a group of travelers adopts a pace that, over time, is unaffected by the individual members’ walking speeds. The difference between walking speeds can be significant during combat, but during an overland journey, the difference vanishes as travelers pause to catch their breath, the faster ones wait for the slower ones, and one traveler’s quickness is matched by another traveler’s endurance.</p><p>A character bestride a phantom steed, soaring through the air on a <a href=https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5373-carpet-of-flying>carpet of flying</a>, or riding a sailboat or a steam-powered gnomish contraption doesn’t travel at a normal rate, since the magic, engine, or wind doesn’t tire the way a creature does and the air doesn’t contain the types of obstructions found on land. When a creature is traveling with a flying speed or with a speed granted by magic, an engine, or a natural force (such as wind or a water current), translate that speed into travel rates using the following rules:</p><ul><li>In 1 minute, you can move a number of feet equal to your speed times 10.</li><li>In 1 hour, you can move a number of miles equal to your speed divided by 10.</li><li>For daily travel, multiply your hourly rate of travel by the number of hours traveled (typically 8 hours).</li><li>For a fast pace, increase the rate of travel by one-third.</li><li>For a slow pace, multiply the rate by two-thirds.</li></ul><p><strong>For example, a character under the effect of a <a href=https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/wind-walk>wind walk</a> spell gains a flying speed of 300 feet. In 1 minute, the character can move 3,000 feet at a normal pace, 4,000 feet at a fast pace, or 2,000 feet at a slow pace. The character can also cover 20, 30, or 40 miles in an hour. The spell lasts for 8 hours, allowing the character to travel 160, 240, or 320 miles in a day.</strong></p><p>Similarly, a <a href=https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/phantom-steed>phantom steed</a> spell creates a magical mount with a speed of 100 feet that doesn’t tire like a real horse. A character on a phantom steed can cover 1,000 feet in 1 minute at a normal pace, 1,333 feet at a fast pace, or 666 feet at a slow pace. In 1 hour, the character can travel 7, 10, or 13 miles.</p></blockquote><p>So, assuming 8 hours of travel a day at a fast pace, <em>wind walk</em> would get them 320 miles per day, which would have them arrive at Port Nyanzaru in 2000 ÷ 320 = <strong>6 1/4 days</strong>.</p><p>That&rsquo;s basically all you get with one casting of <em>wind walk</em> anyway, but if we had multiple castings we would need to factor in <a href=https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/adventuring#TravelPace>exhaustion rules</a> from the PHB:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Forced March.</strong></p><p>The Travel Pace table assumes that characters travel for 8 hours in day. They can push on beyond that limit, at the risk of <a href=https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Exhaustion>exhaustion</a>.</p><p>For each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, the characters cover the distance shown in the Hour column for their pace, and each character must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour. The DC is 10 <strong>+ 1</strong> for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed saving throw, a character suffers one level of <a href=https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Exhaustion>exhaustion</a> (see <a href=https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/appendix-a-conditions#Unconscious>Appendix A</a>).</p></blockquote><p>If we assume that all those exhaustion saves are successful and movement speed isn’t reduced, 2 castings of <em>wind walk</em> per day would get them there in <strong>just over 3 days</strong>.
Those saves, btw, would be 8 saves of DCs 11, 12, .., 17, 18 per day of travel, and if all of them are successful and movement speed isn&rsquo;t reduced by exhaustion, each traveler would need to make a minimum of 24 saves over the trip.</p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://tlake.io/>&copy; Tanner Lake 2024</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
