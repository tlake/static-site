He felt his armor growing tighter, as if it were shrinking, but the magical equipment was able to adapt its fit to accommodate the new pair of leathery bat wings that were growing from Horns&rsquo; middle back, below his shoulder blades. They finished growing within minutes, and Horns immediately took to the skies to practice and become comfortable with his new appendages.</p><p>The drow <a href=/dnd/npcs/cassandra-belacourt>Cassandra Belacourt</a> requested a ride back to the crumpled wreckage of the <em>scavenger</em> where she recovered the payment that she had used to secure the aid of the now-defeated warband: three <em>soul coins.</em> She requested once more that the party help her get to <a href=/dnd/locations/the-bone-brambles>the Bone Brambles</a>, and they offered to take her there themselves after they managed to free a unicorn. She felt that her own mission was urgent enough to avoid such a delay if possible, and instead offered to buy one of the two <em>devil&rsquo;s rides</em> from the group for the same three <em>soul coins</em> that she had given to the warband. The group seemed amenable to the idea, and happily sold her the motorcycle that <a href=/dnd/characters/haeltin-var-astora>Gray</a> hadn&rsquo;t claimed.</p><p><a href=/dnd/characters/grale>Grale</a> (who had also joined the ranks of folks who woke up on the evil side of the bed) conjured up a <em>minor illusion</em> to show her the destination of <a href=/dnd/npcs/red-ruth>Red Ruth&rsquo;s</a> hut so she could navigate there, then asked what that information was worth; she replied that she&rsquo;d consider it a fair exchange for the potion she gave to <a href=/dnd/characters/gimble-the-diviner>Gimble</a>. The Menagerie wanted to know more about this mouth (and its entity) that Cassandra was hunting down, and failed to conceal their own intentions ― <a href=/dnd/characters/finn>Finn</a> mentioned something about the mouth being a bag, Grale unsuccessfully tried to snatch the <em>bag of devouring</em> from her, and <a href=/dnd/characters/oneshoe>Oneshoe</a> just straight-up blurted out that she&rsquo;d stuck her hand inside it.</p><p>Now that she understood that the bag was in The Menagerie&rsquo;s possession, Cassandra wanted to acquire it from them so she could store it in a secure location - probably not the great library at <a href=/dnd/locations/candlekeep>Candlekeep</a> this time. The Menagerie offered her a deal: if she accompanied and helped them out until such time as they were able to free the unicorn at the Demon Zapper, then they would hand over the <em>bag of devouring.</em> Preferring to complete her reclamations without unnecessary violence, Cassandra agreed, and Grale passed some time talking with her about the Order of the Shadowstalker Monks.</p><p>The group made their way towards <a href=/dnd/locations/arkhans-tower>Arkhan&rsquo;s tower</a> (Finn and Horns tried unsuccessfully to communicate with the being attached to the mouth of the <em>bag of devouring</em>), and <a href=/dnd/characters/zed>Zed</a> took over the helm from Bullwinkle in order to bring the Anti-Chrysler to a stop in front of the twenty-by-twenty-feet gates of the ramparts. The ramparts themselves were about fifty feet tall, and forty feet deep. <a href=/dnd/characters/val>Val</a> approached the gates, the great white dragon landed upon the top of the tower to watch the group intently, and one of the undead atop the ramparts slumped over the edge and called down, &ldquo;whoooooo?&rdquo;</p><p>Zed informed the zombie that The Menagerie was here to see <a href=/dnd/npcs/arkhan>Arkhan</a>, and the figure disappeared back over the ramparts. Several minutes later, a small steel plate set into a more-reasonably-sized door within the greater gate door slid open and revealed a gray, weathered, reptilian face. The creature demanded to know the identity and business of the visitors, and Val was unwilling to disclose any information. After some stalemate back-and-forth, the reptilian creature just closed the metal plate again, being of the opinion that if the group wasn&rsquo;t willing to cooperate then they could get bent. Zed regained the creature&rsquo;s attention, and introduced Val as Oneshoe.</p><p>The steel plate slid back open, and the creature introduced itself as <a href=/dnd/npcs/krull>Krull</a>. The Menagerie eventually managed to convery that they were looking for Arkhan because they wanted to trade an <em>orb of dragonkind,</em> and Krull was convinced that this was significant enough to merit that he should lead the group to Arkhan. Another few minutes later, Krull - a weathered tortle wielding a skullish mace and whose spiky shell was covered with carved draconic runes - flew over the ramparts riding on a blue dragon named Vistalancer, and took a moment to order an undead to throw itself down from the ramparts. He prodded the crumpled heap of zombie back to its feet, positioned it in front of the gate, and hung an &ldquo;Out To Lunch&rdquo; sign around its neck, then remounted the dragon and bade the party to follow.</p><blockquote><p><img src=/images/dnd/monster-krull.png alt="krull the tortle"></p><p><em>Image property of Wizards of the Coast LLC.</em></p></blockquote><p>Krull led the party across Avernus and through a twisting, maze-like geography of trails that wound between severe, towering plateaus. After navigating this terrain, the land before them stretched out in an immense, shallowly-sloping bowl shape, littered with more detritus, and bones the size of houses. At the far end of this gradual descent rested an enormous dragon&rsquo;s skull, jutting out from a giant mountain. Near the skull, nestled among the gargantuan bones stood a military tent, guarded by almost a dozen white, reptilian, winged creatures with gleaming blades. Krull told the party to wait while he convinced Arkhan and his coterie to not kill them outright, and he flew off to the tent. Vistalancer took the opportunity to lay down, curving around three sides of the tent.</p><blockquote><p><img src=/images/dnd/monster-white-abishai.png alt="white abishai"></p><p><em>Image property of Wizards of the Coast LLC.</em></p></blockquote><p>Minutes later, Krull reemerged from the tent and beckoned The Menagerie to approach. Following him out of the tent stepped a large, musclebound <em>minotaur,</em> bedecked in golden accoutrements and wielding a matched pair of gilded swords, as well as a red-scaled dragonborn in heavy plate armor, with a wicked-looking axe hung at his waist. The dragonborn introduced himself as Arkhan and the <em>minotaur</em> as his general, <a href=/dnd/npcs/torogar-steelfist>Torogar Steelfist</a>, and got straight to the point in asking why the group had sought him out. The Menagerie explained their purpose, and proposed a trade of the <em>orb of dragonkind</em> for the vial of Tiamat&rsquo;s blood. Arkhan wasn&rsquo;t opposed to the idea, but first he demanded that the party convince him why it would be more advantageous for him to participate in the trade than it would be for his assembly to take it and anything else the group might have by force.</p><blockquote><p><img src=/images/dnd/monster-torogar-steelfist.png alt="torogar steelfist"></p><p><em>Image property of Wizards of the Coast LLC.</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><img src=/images/dnd/monster-arkhan-the-cruel.png alt="arkhan the cruel"></p><p><em>Image property of Wizards of the Coast LLC.</em></p></blockquote><p>Several varied, disparate, and unsuccessful attempts at persuasion later, both parties seemed to be on the verge of combat. Then, through odd behavior, something like intimidation, and a suggestion that they would drop the <em>orb of dragonkind</em> into the <em>bag of devouring,</em> the Menagerie managed to convince Arkhan that pursuing the trade deal would end up being the more beneficial course of action. He lifted a crystal vial from around his neck, passed it to one of a pair of the reptilian creatures, and directed them to perform the trade. The crystal vial was released into The Menagerie&rsquo;s clutches at the same time as Horns dropped the <em>orb of dragonkind</em> into the waiting claw of the second pale fiend, and the pair returned to Arkhan&rsquo;s side.</p><p>Val followed up the exchange with a few inquiries about <a href=/dnd/npcs/tiamat>Tiamat</a>: whether Arkhan was a herald (he didn&rsquo;t consider himself as such), how powerful he might be compared to the average herald of Tiamat (he&rsquo;s never been defeated by one), what it&rsquo;s like to serve under the Queen of Dragons (depends on the nature of the pact; in his case, he&rsquo;s less a servant and more an independent contractor), and so on. Arkhan told her that Tiamat rewards those who prove themselves particularly strong or cunning. Val wanted to speak with Tiamat, and Arkhan ― seeing that she possessed <a href=/dnd/npcs/hawthorne-macdarmott>Hawthorne MacDarmott&rsquo;s</a> sword ― extended to her an offer to duel him. She got ticked off by such a weird hierarchy, stating that it made no sense for Tiamat to have arranged such a gatekeeping hierarchy when she&rsquo;s bored and locked up; Arkhan told her that she understood very little about the nature of the Queen of Dragons&rsquo; imprisonment, and that the combat was no edict of Tiamat&rsquo;s, but a test of his own. Val didn&rsquo;t want to try and go toe-to-toe with Arkhan, and she backed down.</p><p>Having acquired a powerful artifact, and with no signs of an imminent combat, Arkhan saw no reason to continue treating with The Menagerie. He dismissed them, eager to return to his work, and they left, eager to start tying up some of their loose ends.</p><p>Cassandra had parked her <em>devil&rsquo;s ride</em> in the Anti-Chrysler&rsquo;s cargo hatch and rode on top of the warmachine with the rest of the group. She took a moment to connect with Oneshoe, and the two had a conversation about several of the members&rsquo; recklessness, how dangerous these past few hours had been, and how close to disaster events had nearly turned out. The group asked her a little more about what her plans for the <em>bag of devouring</em> were and she told them that she and The Reclamation would need to find a safer place for it, now that its previous storage location was no longer a secret. Horns suggested that maybe The Menagerie should be entrusted with its safekeeping, and Cassandra laughed; The Menagerie are some of the sorts of people from whom these sorts of dangerous artifacts must be kept.</p><p>The party navigated their way safely back to <a href=/dnd/npcs/uldrak>Uldrak&rsquo;s</a> ashen valley, and located the <em>spined devil</em> once more. Val handed over the crystal vial and urged him to spill as little as possible because she wanted to keep some to explore what sorts of curses she could impose upon the Queen of Dragons. Uldrak asked her if she had another container warded enough to contain his titan form&rsquo;s blood, then, or if she had planned to mix his blood in the vial with any leftover of Tiamat&rsquo;s blood, and Val decided to push that problem off until a little later. Uldrak dripped a little of the thick blood onto the ground&mldr; and then a little bit more. Nothing happened, and he kept going, until he had emptied the entire vial. He stared at The Menagerie as nothing continued to happen, and asked them if they were sure that they had obtained <em>Tiamat&rsquo;s</em> blood. As the party began to question the validity of the vial&rsquo;s contents, Uldrak&rsquo;s body suddenly split and expanded into an exponentially larger creature: a statuesque, herculean figure standing at least 25 feet tall.</p><blockquote><p><img src=/images/dnd/monster-empyrean.png alt="uldrak the empyrean"></p><p><em>Image property of Wizards of the Coast LLC.</em></p></blockquote><p>Some of Uldrak&rsquo;s memories seemed to be restored, and some of his madness seemed to fade. He was able to tell the group that he had originally ventured into the Hells to gain glory for his deity, Surtur - a god within the pantheon of giants, most commonly worshipped by <em>fire giants.</em> He espoused the purity of Surtur&rsquo;s holy flame, and Horns thought that was a cool thing - until Uldrak painted Surtur&rsquo;s radiant fire as a righteous, cleansing blaze standing in opposition to the corrupted hellfire that backed Horns&rsquo; infernal heritage.</p><p>Having been broken and wretched for so long, Uldrak&rsquo;s next goal was to find a way out of Avernus to reconnect with Surtur and reforge his sword. He remained true to his word, and overfilled the crystal vial with his blood before bidding the party farewell and leaving in quest of an exit. Val hurried to try and recover some of Tiamat&rsquo;s blood, and scooped some of the bloodsoaked ash and cracked dirt into an empty flask before the group piled back onto the Anti-Chrysler. Unfortunately, after a few minutes Val noticed that Tiamat&rsquo;s blood had proven unnaturally caustic and had eaten through the flask.</p><p>The <em>demon grinder</em> Anti-Chrysler trundled faithfully once more across the blasted wasteland of Avernus, this time bound for <a href=/dnd/npcs/ralzala>Ralzala</a> and the Demon Zapper. The ever-present roiling clouds grew darker and heavier, the winds began to pick up, and scattered storms of a pale yellow-green rain churned for miles all around the Menagerie. Their journey took them near to a pair of ruined and weather-worn pyramids. A narrow passage cut through the middle of the two pyramids, and the sides of the pyramids that bordered that passage were vertical, not sloped like the rest of the pyramids&rsquo; walls. As the group drew closer to the landmarks, they noticed the familiar warmachines and bright tents that made up <a href=/dnd/locations/the-wandering-emporium>the Wandering Emporium</a>, set up in the middle of the cut between the pyramids. At the entrance of the horseshoe-shaped formation of the Emporium&rsquo;s warmachines was a new addition: a well-maintained but otherwise ordinary-looking wooden wagon, complete with wooden wheels, and a wooden falling tongue that jutted out and ended in a wooden yoke that could accomodate a pair of pack animals. Proud, golden letters were stenciled onto the sides of the wagon:</p><p>GRUNDLE & CHODE&rsquo;S<br>ARCANE BOUTIQUE</p><h2 id=dramatis-personae>Dramatis Personae</h2><h3 id=the-party>The Party</h3><ul><li><a href=/dnd/characters/finn>Finn</a></li><li><a href=/dnd/characters/horns>Horns</a></li><li><a href=/dnd/characters/gimble-the-diviner>Gimble</a></li><li><a href=/dnd/characters/grale>Grale</a></li><li><a href=/dnd/characters/haeltin-var-astora>Gray</a></li><li><a href=/dnd/characters/oneshoe>Oneshoe</a></li><li><a href=/dnd/characters/val>Val</a></li><li><a href=/dnd/characters/zed>Zed</a></li></ul><h3 id=returning>Returning</h3><ul><li><a href=/dnd/npcs/cassandra-belacourt>Cassandra Belacourt</a></li><li><a href=/dnd/npcs/uldrak>Uldrak</a></li></ul><h3 id=new>New</h3><ul><li><a href=/dnd/npcs/krull>Krull</a></li><li><a href=/dnd/npcs/torogar-steelfist>Torogar Steelfist</a></li></ul><h3 id=mentioned>Mentioned</h3><ul><li><a href=/dnd/npcs/arkhan>Arkhan</a></li><li><a href=/dnd/npcs/hawthorne-macdarmott>Hawthorne MacDarmott</a></li><li><a href=/dnd/npcs/ralzala>Ralzala</a></li><li><a href=/dnd/npcs/red-ruth>Red Ruth</a></li><li><a href=/dnd/npcs/tiamat>Tiamat</a></li></ul><h2 id=quotations>Quotations</h2><h2 id=inventory>Inventory</h2><h2 id=trivia>Trivia</h2><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://tlake.io/>&copy; Tanner Lake 2024</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
