After only a couple of hours, Red Ruth came back from her spa treatment looking centuries younger and perfectly willing to divulge to the party her knowledge of how to free <a href=/dnd/npcs/ralzala>Ralzala</a> from her pact with <a href=/dnd/npcs/zariel>Zariel</a>.</p><p>The trick was simply for Ralzala to consume the blood of a titan, and Red Ruth told the group about a titan named <a href=/dnd/npcs/uldrak>Uldrak</a> who, many years ago, attempted to slay <a href=/dnd/npcs/tiamat>Tiamat</a>. He failed, and the Queen of Dragons punished him accordingly. Uldrak wasn&rsquo;t slain, but he was&mldr; changed. Red Ruth described his resting place in a valley of ash and explained how to get there, and offered the Menagerie one more opportunity to purchase some of her potions for <em>soul coins.</em> They declined, then hopped aboard their trusty <em>demon grinder</em> - recently nicknamed the &ldquo;Anti-Chrysler.&rdquo;</p><p>After a couple hours&rsquo; travel, their destination loomed upon the horizon - a series of small peaks, rocky and barren, standing sentinel around the borders of a valley. No gouts of fire or flowing magma hinted that this range was volcanic, but many of them vented black ash into the air. The dark flakes settled all around the area; the violent, unpredictable winds of Avernus prevented the outlands from developing a particularly heavy layer of ash, but deep fields and drifts of soot collected within the valley due to the comparatively still air currents.</p><p>The <em>demon grinder</em> drove on into the charcoal valley, and eventually the party came upon a peak similar to those that ringed the valley. A large cave had been worn or worked into the side of the peak, and within the hollow rested a battered helm, three or four times the size of any that <a href=/dnd/characters/zed>Zed</a> might hope to wear. Beside the helm was a sword of complementary size, cracked and chipped, and driven into the ground.</p><p>The group approached and began investigating the area, and their presence prompted the issuance of a voice from within the helm. It talked to itself as much as it talked to them, and it frequently slipped out of Common and into Giant. Then, a small <em>spined devil</em> emerged, and confirmed to the party that he was indeed Uldrak. It became apparent that Uldrak&rsquo;s current form would not be able to provide the blood of a titan needed to break Ralzala&rsquo;s pact, and in order for him to regain his former glory, he would need to spill Tiamat&rsquo;s blood upon the ground - an ironic requirement, since it was his failure to do so as a titan that bound him to this weakened form.</p><p>The party was willing to help, though, and Uldrak took a chance. He gave them the orb from the pommel of his sword and told the Menagerie of a dragonborn named <a href=/dnd/npcs/arkhan>Arkhan</a> who serves the Queen of Dragons, and who carries a reliquary of her blood around his neck. The orb was to be a bargaining chip; if they could acquire the reliquary and return it to Uldrak, he could decant its contents, thus spilling Tiamat&rsquo;s blood upon the ground, thus restoring his titanic form, thus enabling him to gift the party some of his own blood, thus freeing Ralzala from her pact, thus freeing the group to set the unicorn free without needing to fight Ralzala as well as potentially establishing a relationship with <a href=/dnd/npcs/bel>Bel</a> by way of Ralzala&rsquo;s introduction.</p><p>With <a href=/dnd/npcs/lulu>Lulu&rsquo;s</a> help, the Menagerie identified what was likely to be <a href=/dnd/locations/arkhans-tower>Arkhan&rsquo;s tower</a> on the map, and once more took the <em>demon grinder</em> out across Avernus. En route, they were set upon by four large vulture-harpy-like creatures: <em>vrocks.</em> They were able to match speed with the <em>demon grinder</em> and attacked the party, hoping to pick some of them off for an easy meal.</p><blockquote><p><img src=/images/dnd/monster-vrock.png alt=vrock></p><p><em>(Image property of Wizards of the Coast LLC.)</em></p></blockquote><p><a href=/dnd/characters/oneshoe>Oneshoe</a> got in some good whacks with the <em>demon grinder&rsquo;s</em> trusty wrecking ball, and <a href=/dnd/characters/val>Val</a> kept the machine screaming on its course while firing off arrows. <a href=/dnd/characters/horns>Horns</a> made good use of a harpoon station, and <a href=dnd/characters/finn>Finn</a> was a small ball of fury beside him whenever a <em>vrock</em> got close. <a href=/dnd/characters/grale>Grale</a> did a lot of work to turn the tides of battle in the party&rsquo;s favor with his <em>stunning strikes;</em> if the stun was successful, the <em>vrock</em> would be unable to keep up with the warmachine and would just fall behind. One of the <em>vrocks</em> managed to abduct Finn and started to fly away with her, but Horns summoned a flock of <em>giant owls</em> and stole her back from the vulture-harpy.</p><p>Having escaped from or killed the <em>vrocks,</em> the Menagerie kept on truckin&rsquo;. They were able to earn a short rest while Val drove, and they spent some time inspecting the orb that Uldrak had given them. They discovered that it was an <em>orb of dragonkind;</em> a powerful artifact, but very dangerous. The specifics of its abilities would have to wait for a proper <em>identity</em> spell, but they could work out that a malign presence was contained within it, and that it would likely seek to overpower its wielder.</p><p>Meanwhile, Finn&rsquo;s <em>bag of devouring</em> began convulsing and making rhythmic gagging noises, and before long it vomited forth a damp bundle of plant matter. Among those sticks and leaves and slime was another magic item that, after investigation, turned out to be a <em>wand of fear.</em> Soon thereafter, Arkhan&rsquo;s tower loomed up in the distance. A massive white dragon was circling the skies above it, and a host of creatures were just barely visible, shuffling along the tower&rsquo;s surrounding ramparts.</p><blockquote><p><img src=/images/dnd/magic-item-wand-of-fear.png alt="wand of fear"></p><p><em>(Image property of Wizards of the Coast LLC.)</em></p></blockquote><h2 id=dramatis-personae>Dramatis Personae</h2><h3 id=the-party>The Party</h3><ul><li><a href=/dnd/characters/finn>Finn</a></li><li><a href=/dnd/characters/gimble-the-diviner>Gimble</a></li><li><a href=/dnd/characters/grale>Grale</a></li><li><a href=/dnd/characters/horns>Horns</a></li><li><a href=/dnd/characters/oneshoe>Oneshoe</a></li><li><a href=/dnd/characters/val>Val</a></li><li><a href=/dnd/characters/zed>Zed</a></li></ul><h3 id=returning>Returning</h3><ul><li><a href=/dnd/npcs/lulu>Lulu</a></li><li><a href=/dnd/npcs/red-ruth>Red Ruth</a></li></ul><h3 id=new>New</h3><ul><li><a href=/dnd/npcs/uldrak>Uldrak</a></li></ul><h3 id=mentioned>Mentioned</h3><ul><li><a href=/dnd/npcs/arkhan>Arkhan</a></li><li><a href=/dnd/npcs/bel>Bel</a></li><li><a href=/dnd/npcs/ralzala>Ralzala</a></li><li><a href=/dnd/npcs/tiamat>Tiamat</a></li><li><a href=/dnd/npcs/zariel>Zariel</a></li></ul><h2 id=quotations>Quotations</h2><h2 id=inventory>Inventory</h2><p>Gained:</p><ul><li>1 <em>wand of fear</em></li></ul><h2 id=trivia>Trivia</h2><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://tlake.io/>&copy; Tanner Lake 2024</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
