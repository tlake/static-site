Zed used his <em>necklace of prayer beads</em> and cast <em>greater restoration</em> on Finn to see if he could shake her out of the dark funk that she&rsquo;d been in, and it worked! Finn felt a heretofore unnoticed thorny constriction around her heart lessen and withdraw, and she was back to her own natural alignment.</p><p>So buoyed, the group set off for the Demon Zapper. Val took the helm of the Anti-Chrysler, much to the chagrin of Bullwinkle who kept trying to reach a hoof in to take over the steering. Finn spent a bit of time with the <em>bag of devouring,</em> and interpreted the low, rumbling sound issuing forth as a purr, not a growl. Gray practiced his stunting, Horns practiced his flying, and Zed started reading the <em>Peregrine&rsquo;s Guide.</em> He noticed an impossibly thin piece of vellum folded up inside the volume, and his remarking upon it caught Val&rsquo;s attention. After a very brief investigation, she concluded that it must be another part of the map/document that she had been trying to piece together. Zed handed it over to her, and she tucked it away.</p><p>The Demon Zapper came into view about two hours later, and as they approached the weapon they noticed the black ichor remains of demons recently annihilated by its radiant beam. OneShoe deftly filled her four empty flasks with the stuff, and then the group called out for Ralzala the <em>dao.</em> She appeared from the earth beneath the Zapper, and the vial containing Uldrak&rsquo;s blood was turned over to her. She drank it and made some inner exertion of will, then smiled in satisfaction as an enormous scarlet bolt of lightning arced across the Avernian sky. She and Val moved a goodly distance away from the Zapper, and she began to compose the writ of introduction to Bel for the group as promised.</p><p>Meanwhile, OneShoe began to batter one of the mandible-like pillars of the Demon Zapper&rsquo;s structure, and Zed, Bullwinkle, and Horns took to the air to do whatever they could to ease the unicorn&rsquo;s descent once the cage was disrupted. Red-orange energy sparked from the fissures of the damaged pillar, then arced wildly as OneShoe&rsquo;s wrecking ball smashed through it. As the tip of the pillar fell away from the light cage, a previously-invisible tether of arcane energy connecting the cage to the pillar grew brighter and brighter, then burst - and the energy composing the cage, no longer structured and held in check, exploded. Several of the nearby party were battered by the shockwave, but the air crew were able to gently deliver the unicorn to the ground.</p><p>She was weak, weary, and emaciated, but grew in coherence and strength as Horns fed her some <em>goodberries.</em> She telepathically introduced herself as Mooncolor, and spent a moment trying to find a common language between them all; unfortunately, there was no single language shared by all present, so Mooncolor continued her telepathic communication.</p><blockquote><p><img src=/images/dnd/monster-unicorn.png alt=Mooncolor></p><p><em>(Image property of Wizards of the Coast LLC.)</em></p></blockquote><p>Ralzala finished her letter and handed it off to Val, then made to depart. Val inquired about the <em>dao&rsquo;s</em> plans and asked if she wanted to join up with The Menagerie. Ralzala she said that she had no desire to stay here and be beholden to anyone else&rsquo;s agenda, and that she was going to go back to her native plane - the plane of elemental earth - to forge a new life. Val tried to establish a future working relationship with Ralzala should the party ever find themselves on the plane of earth, and Ralzala responded with a noncommittal shrug. She bid Val goodbye, and took her leave of Avernus.</p><p>By now, the rest of The Menagerie had introduced themselves to Mooncolor, and the unicorn expressed her desire to repay the group for her rescue. She felt that nothing she could do now in Avernus would be enough, but she took a moment to take stock of the party, her soft monochrome-yellow eyes gazing into the eyes of each of The Menagerie in turn. Then she approached Gray and told him that she wasn&rsquo;t going to hurt him as she lowered her horn towards him. Gray&rsquo;s modus operandi for weird shit has historically been to just let it happen, and he held true to this axiom here as well. As her horn touched his shoulder, a purifying warmth flooded through him, and he too was restored to his natural alignment.</p><p>The Menagerie began to consider what next to do. Like most creatures not native to Avernus that the party had encountered so far, Mooncolor wanted to leave and return to her home plane of Mount Celestia - however, she lacked the ability to do so herself. Moreover, Cassandra broached the subject of the fulfillment of her bargain with The Menagerie. The drow had agreed to stay with and assist the party however she could until such time as they freed the unicorn; thereafter, they party would hand over the <em>bag of devouring</em> and she would be able to depart Avernus and deliver it to somewhere safe. Finn gave the <em>bag</em> a departing pet and passed it over to Cassandra (a thick tonguelike tendril squirmed out of the <em>bag</em> and tried to ensnare Finn&rsquo;s hand as she released it, but to no avail) who quickly bound the bag closed with a length of small chain and stuffed it into her pack.</p><p>Cassandra was able to transport Mooncolor with her out of Avernus, and agreed to do so. The two groups made their goodbyes, and Cassandra began the process of casting <em>plane shift.</em> Before the spell could finish, however, a deep rumbling shook the ground; it grew louder and drew closer, and then the ground near Cassandra and partially beneath the <em>demon grinder</em> exploded into the air and a great <em>wurm,</em> covered in broad, black, chitinous plates burst forth. The Anti-Chrysler was flipped over onto its back, and the eyeless head of the <em>wurm</em> thrashed about, its cavernous maw full of rows upon rows of serrated teeth quested about for prey. Several of The Menagerie responded with an immediate offensive; OneShoe took shots from behind the <em>demon grinder,</em> Horns summoned a flock of <em>giant owls,</em> Finn and Gray closed distance and focused their efforts on a concentrated area of the monster&rsquo;s plates. Cassandra was taken by surprise and lost her <em>plane shift</em> concentration, Mooncolor created a magical shield around Not-Bailey, who wanted nothing to do with this <em>wurm</em> and kept OneShoe company behind the <em>demon grinder,</em> and Val let loose a <em>lightning bolt</em> from her <em>wand of wonder.</em> Zed and Bullwinkle launched an aerial assault, intending to dart in and back out, but the mouth of the <em>wurm</em> caught them in their retreat and they disappeared down the monster&rsquo;s gullet.</p><p>Then then <em>wurm,</em> with Zed and Bullwinkle inside, burrowed underground once more and began to make an escape.</p><p>Cassandra guesstimated the <em>wurm&rsquo;s</em> location and cast <em>passwall,</em> opening up a door-shaped tunnel through the earth that exposed the <em>wurm</em> to the party above and OneShoe, thinking quickly, hurled a <em>bead of force</em> down upon the monster. It successfully manged to encapsulate the thing, and then began the waiting game. The <em>wurm</em> couldn&rsquo;t go anywhere, and the party couldn&rsquo;t bring attacks to bear through the barrier of the <em>bead of force,</em> but Zed and Bullwinkle were able to lay the creature low by wreaking merry havoc on its internals. They forced their way back up through the dead <em>wurm&rsquo;s</em> throat and found that the <em>bead of force</em> prevented them from leaving the toothy mouth. There they remained for almost a full minute until the <em>bead&rsquo;s</em> effect dissipated, harvesting teeth while they waited.</p><p>After the battle, goodbyes were once more bandied around, and Cassandra set about the casting of another <em>plane shift</em> spell. A powerful debate churned within Horns over whether or not to try and steal the <em>bag of devouring</em> back from Cassandra at the last moment. He decided against it. The spell completed, and the drow and the unicorn were ferried away from Avernus.</p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://tlake.io/>&copy; Tanner Lake 2024</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
