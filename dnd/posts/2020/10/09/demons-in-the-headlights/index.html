Did they want to consult Red Ruth instead, or otherwise find their own way to the hidden resting place of <em>the ring of Zariel?</em> Did they want to bother with Mad Maggie&rsquo;s fetch quest at all? Or perhaps they should just abandon Horns to his court summons and get the hell out of hell?</p><p>Eventually the group resolved to continue on their current path, and they set off in search of Bel&rsquo;s Forge, the heart of a massive volcano somewhere on Avernus. Ralzala the Dao had pointed out the location on their map, so they had a workable idea of what to envision as they traveled across the war-torn wastes, and within a couple of hours, a vast plume of dark smoke grew visible upon the horizon. They drove toward it, and more and more of the volcano revealed itself, appearing to grow from and rise above the distant horizon line.</p><p>Then, as they closed more distance, they could make out a frenzied skirmish line surrounding the volcano in a rough horseshoe shape, the open mouth of the horseshoe butting up against where the river Styx flowed near Bel&rsquo;s Forge. A fortified infernal force was arrayed on the interior line of the skirmish, while a much smaller and far more unorganized demonic incursion flung itself savagely against the volcano&rsquo;s defenders.</p><p>The Blood War stood between The Menagerie and their destination.</p><p>Goatlike <em>bulezau,</em> rampaging <em>barlgura,</em> chitinous <em>glabrezu,</em> and even a number of <em>nalfeshnee</em> were bent on wreaking as much destruction as they could. In the skies, <em>vrocks</em> and <em>chasme</em> harried the devilish host, but the complement of <em>bone devils, barbed devils, bearded devils,</em> and the beautiful but terrifying <em>erinyes</em> held strong, staunching the attack through superior tactics, position, and discipline. The demonic combatants didn&rsquo;t number large enough to have much hope of breaking through the defense and assaulting the volcano, but accomplishing a tactical military victory was far outpaced and overpowered by demonic cruelty and lust for violence.</p><p>The Menagerie saw a few potential options before them. The Styx was wide and deep, but they could try to develop some temporary method of traversing it; just enough of a solution to get them around the combat and onto the slopes of the volcano. They could try to all gather up in whatever flight formations they could sum together in order to avoid most of the fighting by an aerial route, likely abandoning their warmachines in the process. Or, they could find one of the less intense sections of the battle and try to punch their way through on the warmachines.</p><p>They began circling the skirmish at several hundred yards, and when Val identified a piece of the battle that wasn&rsquo;t <em>as</em> thick with combat, she dumped a flask of demon ichor into the <em>demon grinder</em> and drove the party into the fight. The plan was to deal as much damage to the demons as they could while not bringing arms against the infernal defenders and wind up on the other side of the horseshoe all alive and well, and hopefully not be immediately set upon by devils. Additionally, the group identified a nearby <em>nalfeshnee</em> as likely the most dangerous single target, so they hoped that they could get through the battle fast enough to avoid attracting its attention.</p><p>The fray was thick with fiendish bodies, and Val at the help of the <em>demon grinder</em> made great use of its bulk to slam into the creatures. At the front, in the chomper station, Finn raged, and as a side effect, emitted a thicc beam of radiant energy from her chest like a Care Bear with an Arc Reactor. Grale sent a couple of harpoons into the throng, and Horns brought the wrecking ball to bear on any demons that would close in in their wake. Val set the whirling doodads of her <em>wand of wonder</em> to spinning and caused a burst of colorful light to explode from her, blinding several creatures around her (<em>most</em> of them were enemies), and Gray laid a <em>blood curse</em> upon an incoming <em>glabrezu</em>.</p><p>Infernal warriors made short work of the blinded demons, but a <em>glabrezu</em> at the back of the <em>demon grinder</em> slammed Horns with <em>power word stun</em> while a <em>barlgura</em> climbed up on the tiefling&rsquo;s other side. They proceeded to deal terrible damage to Horns, but Grale and Gray leapt to his defense with stuns, the <em>staff of the monkey king,</em> and the <em>chains of the black inferno.</em> At the front of the Anti-Chrysler, Finn decapitated a <em>barlgura,</em> and Val dropped an elephant on top of a <em>glabrezu</em> via the <em>wand of wonder.</em></p><p>The <em>demon grinder</em> growled and finally managed to bull its way through the last of the demons, crushing several beneath its spiked wheels, and one more issuance from Val&rsquo;s <em>wand of wonder</em> cast a <em>fireball</em> behind the warmachine. The devils managed to see the Anti-Chrysler coming and made way, and The Menagerie found themselves on the interior side of the skirmish line, more or less intact.</p><p>But the fight wasn&rsquo;t over.</p><p>Maybe it was blast of the <em>fireball,</em> or maybe it was the screaming of the <em>demon grinder,</em> or maybe it was just that they had broken through the lines of combat; whatever the reason, the <em>nalfeshnee</em> that The Menagerie had been avoiding disappeared from the battle and reappeared on top of the Anti-Chrysler, behind the helm, right next to Horns.</p><hr><h3 id=demons>Demons</h3><p><em>Bulezau</em></p><blockquote><p><img src=/images/dnd/monster-bulezau.png alt=Bulezau></p><p><em>(Image property of Wizards of the Coast LLC.)</em></p></blockquote><p><em>Barlgura</em></p><blockquote><p><img src=/images/dnd/monster-barlgura.png alt=Barlgura></p><p><em>(Image property of Wizards of the Coast LLC.)</em></p></blockquote><p><em>Glabrezu</em></p><blockquote><p><img src=/images/dnd/monster-glabrezu.png alt=Glabrezu></p><p><em>(Image property of Wizards of the Coast LLC.)</em></p></blockquote><p><em>Nalfeshnee</em></p><blockquote><p><img src=/images/dnd/monster-nalfeshnee.png alt=Nalfeshnee></p><p><em>(Image property of Wizards of the Coast LLC.)</em></p></blockquote><p><em>Vrock</em></p><blockquote><p><img src=/images/dnd/monster-vrock.png alt=Vrock></p><p><em>(Image property of Wizards of the Coast LLC.)</em></p></blockquote><p><em>Chasme</em></p><blockquote><p><img src=/images/dnd/monster-chasme.png alt=Chasme></p><p><em>(Image property of Wizards of the Coast LLC.)</em></p></blockquote><h3 id=devils>Devils</h3><p><em>Bearded Devil</em></p><blockquote><p><img src=/images/dnd/monster-bearded-devil.png alt="Bearded Devil"></p><p><em>(Image property of Wizards of the Coast LLC.)</em></p></blockquote><p><em>Barbed Devil</em></p><blockquote><p><img src=/images/dnd/monster-barbed-devil.png alt="Barbed Devil"></p><p><em>(Image property of Wizards of the Coast LLC.)</em></p></blockquote><p><em>Bone Devil</em></p><blockquote><p><img src=/images/dnd/monster-bone-devil.png alt=Bulezau></p><p><em>(Image property of Wizards of the Coast LLC.)</em></p></blockquote><p><em>Erinyes</em></p><blockquote><p><img src=/images/dnd/monster-erinyes.png alt=Erinyes></p><p><em>(Image property of Wizards of the Coast LLC.)</em></p></blockquote><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://tlake.io/>&copy; Tanner Lake 2024</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
