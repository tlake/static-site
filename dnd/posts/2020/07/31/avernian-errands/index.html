They found a sort of clearing - the canopy still closed the expanse from exterior light - in the middle of which rose a wattle-and-daub hut-like entrance to a path leading down into the earth.
The threshold was decorated with hanging bones, and the ceiling of the descent was festooned with draped intestines.
As the party debated how they would approach <a href=/dnd/npcs/red-ruth>Red Ruth</a>, an old woman&rsquo;s voice called out, asking who was loitering on her front stoop.</p><p>The group was invited in, and the sloping tunnel opened up into a modest, subterranean home.
Dried herbs, cured meats, skinned animals, and various tools hung from rafters.
It was dark, the only light coming from a small cooking fire in the kitchen portion of the big room.
<a href=/dnd/characters/horns>Horns</a> used <em>thaumaturgy</em> to brighten the fire, and was surprised to find that the fire itself resisted him - almost as if it were a living thing.
The Menagerie was greeted by the hunched figure of Red Ruth, a night hag, clad in a dress of sewn-together bones.
A necklace of infant skulls looped around her neck, and she asked if the party were here to purchase some of her blood potions.</p><p>The group communicated their intentions to Red Ruth, and she told them that she indeed would be able to lead them to the method to free <a href=/dnd/npcs/ralzala>Ralzala</a> from her pact - but they would have to do something for her in exchange.
In <a href=/dnd/locations/the-wandering-emporium>the Wandering Emporium</a> exists a business called the Infernal Rapture, and among the services offered there is a spa treatment.
Red Ruth states that she hasn&rsquo;t had the chance to properly bathe in a couple hundred years, so if the group would make her a spa appointment and then guard her home while she attends the treatment, she would lead them towards the mechanism by which Ralzala could be freed.
The party did not know where the Wandering Emporium was, but Red Ruth had a solution to that as well: she plunged a clawed hand into her abdomen and scattered her blood upon the floor, then interpreted the patterns to divine its location.
She told the party that the Emporium was currently set up in the middle of a fiery plains not too far from here, and the Menagerie took their leave.</p><p>Horns gave the <em>demon grinder&rsquo;s</em> key to <a href=/dnd/characters/val>Val</a>, and the group tore off towards the fire plains.
At the environ&rsquo;s outskirts, Val took some time to try and study the flame geysers&rsquo; eruptions in an attempt to identify a pattern.
She learned that the eruptions were pretty random, but some of the bigger eruptions were presaged by a second or two of noticeable rumbling.
Horns took to the sky as a giant eagle to scout for the Emporium from a distance, and Val kicked the <em>demon grinder</em> into high gear across the burning wastes.</p><p>Val&rsquo;s quick reflexes led to the avoidance of most of the geysers via <del>Tokyo</del> Avernus drifting, helped out by <a href=/dnd/characters/oneshoe>Oneshoe&rsquo;s</a> manipulation of the wrecking ball to shift the vehicle&rsquo;s distribution of force.
However, she was unable to dodge a particularly large eruption, and the <em>demon grinder</em> was sent tumbling ass over teakettle.
Oneshoe on the wrecking ball and <a href=/dnd/characters/finn>Finn</a> on the chomper both attempted to find a way to control the spin, but couldn&rsquo;t get the timing right.
In a last-second effort, Val waited until the <em>demon grinder</em> was oriented roughly upright and forward-facing in its uncontrolled tumble, then used <em>earthbind</em> to snatch the vehicle out of the air, pull it back down to the ground, and then released the spell just as the wheels touched down in order to preserve the forward momentum of the vehicle.
She pumped a flask of demon ichor into the vehicle to give it a speed boost, and the party raced across the rest of the plains towards the location of the Wandering Emporium under Horns&rsquo; guidance.</p><p>Upon their arrival, the Menagerie was greeted by a sign that read, “All are welcome here. No fighting! No spellcasting! No exceptions!” and a man who introduced himself as <a href=/dnd/npcs/mahadi>Mahadi</a>, the master of the Wandering Emporium and proprietor of the Infernal Rapture.
Setting up Red Ruth&rsquo;s spa appointment was easily done, and then Mahadi gave the party a rundown on what could be found within the Wandering Emporium:</p><dl><dt><strong>Infernal Rapture:</strong></dt><dd><p>Mahadi&rsquo;s business, which offers an array of spa-like treatments as well as a refined dining experience widely known for its quality, neutrality, and privacy.</p></dd><dt><strong>Firesnake Forge:</strong></dt><dd><p>A smithy and material goods outlet, run by three <em>salamanders</em> (Raash, Skids, and Slagg).
Nine <em>magmins</em> and eight suits of <em>animated armor</em> work under the <em>salamanders</em>&rsquo; supervision.
The Forge sells various material goods, and offers infernal warmachine repair services.</p></dd><dt><strong>Burney the Barber:</strong></dt><dd><p>A barbershop and medical station run by a human woman named Burney.</p></dd><dt><strong>From Here to Avernus:</strong></dt><dd><p>A courier and communication depot, run by an <em>amnizu</em> named Fhet&rsquo;Ahla.
In addition to long-distance and interplanar messaging services, Fhet&rsquo;Ahla sometimes operates in the exchange of gold and <em>soul coins.</em></p></dd><dt><strong>Ichor&rsquo;s Aweigh!:</strong></dt><dd><p>A demon ichor outlet run by a malformed human man named Elliach.</p></dd><dt><strong>Z&rsquo;neth&rsquo;s Larva Farm:</strong></dt><dd><p>An old, cranky <em>hobgoblin</em> named Z&rsquo;neth sells yugoloth larva, mostly to hags and the like as dark ritual components.</p></dd></dl><p>First things first, the group went to see the <em>salamanders</em> about their warmachine.
Their standard rate was 50gp per hit point restored (the <em>demon grinder</em> was missing 153 hp), and it would take them about four hours to complete.
Alternatively, if the Menagerie wanted to spring for a rush job, the <em>demon grinder</em> could be restored in an hour at a rate of 100gp per hit point.
The party decided upon the standard rate, paid 7650gp, and started finding ways to pass four hours.</p><p><em>salamander:</em></p><blockquote><p><img src=/images/dnd/monster-salamander.png alt=salamander></p><p><em>(Image property of Wizards of the Coast LLC.)</em></p></blockquote><p><em>magmin</em>:</p><blockquote><p><img src=/images/dnd/monster-magmin.png alt=magmin></p><p><em>(Image property of Wizards of the Coast LLC.)</em></p></blockquote><p><em>animated armor</em>:</p><blockquote><p><img src=/images/dnd/monster-animated-armor.png alt="animated armor"></p><p><em>(Image property of Wizards of the Coast LLC.)</em></p></blockquote><p>They inquired about dining at the Infernal Rapture, and learned that a full course of dining would cost a soul coin for each person.
Val asked if they could spend gold if all they wanted were drinks, and Mahadi seemed amenable to that idea.</p><p><em>Infernal Rapture menu:</em></p><blockquote><p><img src=/images/dnd/misc-infernal-rapture-menu-infernal.png alt="&ldquo;infernal rapture&rdquo; menu (infernal)"></p><p><em>(Image property of Wizards of the Coast LLC.)</em></p></blockquote><p><em>Infernal Rapture menu (common):</em></p><blockquote><p><img src=/images/dnd/misc-infernal-rapture-menu-common.png alt="&ldquo;infernal rapture&rdquo; menu (common)"></p><p><em>(Image property of Wizards of the Coast LLC.)</em></p></blockquote><p>With that in mind, they went to From Here to Avernus to investigate the <em>soul coin</em> exchange.
Fhet&rsquo;Ahla had a total of four <em>soul coins</em> in stock, and was willing to exchange them for 5000gp apiece.
<a href=/dnd/characters/grale>Grale</a> sprung for two of them, and Horns for the other two.
Then the party erupted into a series of arguments about the <em>soul coins</em>.
The party had in their possession nine <em>soul coins</em>, which they reasoned would be enough to pay for the trip downriver to Horns&rsquo; court date.
Horns was interested in spending some of the coins, however, under the logic that <a href=/dnd/npcs/mad-maggie>Mad Maggie</a> had promised at least enough <em>soul coins</em> to get the party one way herself, and that jumping headlong into a one-way trip with no exit strategy wasn&rsquo;t smart.
The argument almost led to a physical and/or magical altercation, but someone in the party remembered the sign at the entrance to the Wandering Emporium.</p><p><em>amnizu</em>:</p><blockquote><p><img src=/images/dnd/monster-amnizu.png alt=amnizu></p><p><em>(Image property of Wizards of the Coast LLC.)</em></p></blockquote><p>Val, Horns, and Grale went back to the Infernal Rapture, still bickering about <em>soul coins</em>, and decided to check out the bar scene.
Mahadi insisted that nobody entered the Rapture without first signing a contract stipulating that all services were to be paid for before leaving the Rapture, and if a party was unable to pay, their soul belonged to Mahadi until he deemed that they had worked off their debt.
Intending only to spend gold, the three of them signed contracts and were graciously ushered inside.</p><p>Within the Infernal Rapture, the three found themselves in a bigger-on-the-inside pocket dimension standing next to a podium that read, &ldquo;please wait to be seated.&rdquo;
Bolts of luxurious fabric hung draped from above, obscuring everything beyond the entrance foyer.
Presently a male tabaxi greeted them and led them to a private booth - the group got the sense that there were other visitors within the Rapture, but they were unable to see anyone else through the obfuscating maze of colorful fabrics.
Val began to order a drink and tried to pay the tabaxi upfront, but he told her that he doesn&rsquo;t handle the money and that their expenses would be settled at the door upon leaving.
This was enough to spook off Val and she asked for her order to be canceled and to be led back to the door.
Grale followed suit, but Horns placed an order for a rich, dark beer.
The tabaxi nodded, escorted Val and Grale to the exit (where they were able to leave unmolested), then returned with Horns&rsquo; beverage.
Unlike everything else that the party had consumed since arriving in Avernus, Horns&rsquo; beer tasted incredible - a rich, dark ambrosia, served at the perfect temperature.
He took his time with it, and with a second round as well, before deciding he was finished an hour and a half later.
The tabaxi thanked him for his business and escorted him to the exit where a golden golem was waiting to collect payment: 100gp, for the two beverages.
Horns paid, and left without incident.</p><p><strong>[As a mechanical benefit to drinking in the Rapture, for the next 24 hours, whenever Horns spends hit dice to regain hit points during a short rest, he may treat each hit die rolled as if it had rolled its highest value.]</strong></p><p>Val spent her four hours in an elven trance, taking a long rest.
Other activities during this timespan included the purchase of three flasks of demon ichor, and Horns buying three yugoloth larvae from Z&rsquo;neth.</p><p>When the <em>demon grinder</em> was finished being repaired, the group all climbed aboard and got ready to return to the Bone Brambles; this time, Grale wanted to drive, and he spent time trying to study the geysers like Val did.
When he felt comfortable enough, he kicked the <em>demon grinder</em> into gear and barrelled off across the plains.</p><p>Hyperfocused on trying to predict the eruptions, Grale sensed that a geyser was about to erupt beneath the grinder too quickly to take evasive action.
Instead, he crammed a flask of demon ichor into the Boost Juice Funnel™️.
Demon ichor is unstable at best, and this time the thick fluid contained something solid that got stuck somewhere in the vehicle&rsquo;s pipelines.
The ichor was only partially able to combust and the exhaust couldn&rsquo;t exit through the normal systems, so thick, oily, black smoke poured out of the dashboard, reducing visibility to zero from within the helm.
Sputtering, Grale swapped places with Val so he could go down to the engine chamber and try to sort out the mess while Val did her best to blindly keep the grinder from crashing into anything.</p><p>After a couple of failed attempts, Horns went down to help Grale try to clear the vents.
The <em>demon grinder</em>, boosted by the ichor and piloted by a blinded Val, barrelled into a huge chunk of sloped stone.
Val was able to reflexively steer the vehicle onto the stone entirely; thus, instead of only one side of the vehicle&rsquo;s wheels going up the incline and flipping the <em>demon grinder</em>, the whole vehicle drove up along the length of the slab and became airborne for a few seconds before slamming back down to the ground.
Shortly thereafter, Grale and Horns managed to clear the vents, and Val regained visibility in time to barely avoid crashing into a massive hulking creature in front of the <em>demon grinder</em>, and as the party rocketed mere inches from the creature, Oneshoe took the opportunity to swing the wrecking ball into the shambling hill of flesh and bones.</p><p>Finally, as the edge of the fire plains came into sight, the engine gave a choking splutter and died, and the <em>demon grinder</em> began to lose speed quickly upon the difficult, uneven ground - just, as luck would have it, at such a time as it would travel over a particularly large geyser when it erupted.
Frustrated, Val fed another soul coin into the engine, and the <em>demon grinder</em> roared back to life and tear-assed out of the plains, leaving the geyser and a torrent of screams in its wake.</p><p>Perhaps an hour after leaving the plains, the Menagerie arrived at the outskirts of the Bone Brambles once more, and made their way into the home at its heart.
Red Ruth was mildly irritated at how long it had taken the group to return, but was pleased to hear that her appointment was made.
Val told her that Horns had brought her a gift, and Red Ruth eagerly sidled up to the tiefling.
Horns reluctantly handed over one of his larvae, and the hag giggled with glee before opening up the jar, pulling out the larva, and slurping it down.
She took a swig from the preservative liquid in the jar, then leaned in close to Horns and planted a wet kiss on his cheek.
She cackled, promised the party that she would be back in several hours, and departed for the Wandering Emporium, leaving her home under the watch of the Menagerie.</p><h2 id=dramatis-personae>Dramatis Personae</h2><h3 id=the-party>The Party</h3><ul><li><a href=/dnd/characters/finn>Finn</a></li><li><a href=/dnd/characters/grale>Grale</a></li><li><a href=/dnd/characters/horns>Horns</a></li><li><a href=/dnd/characters/oneshoe>Oneshoe</a></li><li><a href=/dnd/characters/val>Val</a></li></ul><h3 id=returning>Returning</h3><ul><li><a href=/dnd/npcs/red-ruth>Red Ruth</a></li></ul><h3 id=new>New</h3><ul><li><a href=/dnd/npcs/mahadi>Mahadi</a></li></ul><h3 id=mentioned>Mentioned</h3><ul><li><a href=/dnd/npcs/mad-maggie>Mad Maggie</a></li><li><a href=/dnd/npcs/ralzala>Ralzala</a></li></ul><h2 id=quotations>Quotations</h2><h2 id=inventory>Inventory</h2><p>Gained:</p><ul><li>4 soul coins</li><li>3 flasks of demon ichor</li></ul><p>Lost:</p><ul><li>1 soul coin</li><li>2 flasks of demon ichor</li></ul><h2 id=trivia>Trivia</h2><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://tlake.io/>&copy; Tanner Lake 2024</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
