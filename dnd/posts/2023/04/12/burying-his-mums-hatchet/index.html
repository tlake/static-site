A violent storm assaults the battlefield as the southwest wall of the manor burns. <a href=/dnd/characters/val>Val</a> continues to harry the zombies from below as an earth elemental, remaining mostly out of reach of her frustrated pursuer. <a href=/dnd/characters/haeltin-var-astora>Gray</a> takes the fight to the revenant with some daring aerial maneuvers. Meanwhile, <a href=/dnd/characters/finn>Finn</a> tries desperately to deal with the growing fire in the manor and is surprised when some latent protective magic gifted to her by <a href=/dnd/characters/gimble-the-diviner>Gimble</a> activates and starts absorbing the flames. Outside, the party is starting to take some heavy damage. <a href=/dnd/characters/horns>Horns</a> provides some much-needed group healing to buy some time. But then, the dragon issues a terrible gout of toxic miasma. Gray and <a href=/dnd/characters/oneshoe>Oneshoe</a> are badly hurt, and <a href=/dnd/npcs/gundren-rockseeker>Gundren</a> falls. Horns swoops in to save Gundren and then directs his owls to rip the revenant from the sky.</p><h2 id=synopsis>Synopsis</h2><h3 id=recap>Recap</h3><p><a href=/dnd/characters/val>Val</a>&rsquo;s undying pursuer attempts to flush out his quarry by directing the undead army to assault Tresendar Manor, but the druid proves to be an elusive target. The Revenant only gets in a few shots before Val shifts into an <em>Earth Elemental</em> and sinks into the ground, employing guerrilla tactics from below. <a href=/dnd/characters/oneshoe>Oneshoe</a> evades the patchwork horror and then dispatches it from the shadows. <a href=/dnd/characters/finn>Finn</a> argues with a ghost. Meanwhile in the basement, a breathless Gray wrestles with a rusalka, but <a href=/dnd/npcs/gundren-rockseeker>Gundren Rockseeker</a> comes to his aid! <a href=/dnd/characters/horns>Horns</a> shifts into a <em>Water Elemental</em> and holds off the brunt of the zombie horde on his own. Eventually overwhelmed, Horns responds by summoning a parliament of giant owls which carry him above the fray, just as a violent storm apparates around him and casts him to the ground. The battlefield is in chaos. Gray seizes this moment to perform a flying leap at the revenant atop its dragon mount!</p><h3 id=events>Events</h3><h4 id=battle-at-the-manor>Battle at the Manor</h4><ul><li>Rising from below the earth, <a href=/dnd/characters/val>Val</a> destroys a zombie from within the sleet storm.</li><li><a href=/dnd/characters/finn>Finn</a> wraps herself in a blanket and ambles out of her bedroom.</li><li>The Revenant misty steps out of <a href=/dnd/characters/haeltin-var-astora>Gray</a>&rsquo;s grasp and onto the roof. It then attack Gray in retribution.</li><li>The dragon flies 175 ft straight up, carrying Gray along with it.</li><li><a href=/dnd/characters/oneshoe>Oneshoe</a> hits the revenant with a <em>Sacred Flame</em>.</li><li>Gray shakes off his impending bloodlust and chooses to leap from the back of the dragon. However, the dragon lands a nasty bite first.</li><li>As Gray plummets towards the ground, he invokes his gryphon statuette, which appears just in time.</li><li>On gryphon-back, Gray swoops down to land next to the revenant on the roof.</li><li>A zombie rushes <a href=/dnd/npcs/gundren-rockseeker>Gundren</a> and deals a surprisingly heavy blow.</li><li>Enraged, Gundren and cleaves the zombie in twain.</li><li>Seeing his injured friends, <a href=/dnd/characters/horns>Horns</a> approaches the melee and casts <em>Mass Cure Wounds</em> on the party.</li><li>Meanwhile, the owls desperately try to escape the sleet storm, with varying degrees of success.</li><li>The flameskull smashes a flaming sphere into Gray.</li><li>From below, Val sweeps up and smashes another zombie.</li><li>Finn half-crawls in her blanket and approaches the damaged southern wall of the manor.</li><li>The revenant casts <em>Blight</em> on Gray, who luckily is able to resist the full effect.</li><li>The dragon drops down from the sky and breathes out gout of something truly horrible, and it badly damages much of the party.</li><li>The ghost pops back through the wall to menace Finn again. They have another conversation.</li><li>Oneshoe hits the dragon with a <em>Guiding Bolt</em>.</li><li>From atop his gryphon, Gray restrains the revenant again with his <em>Chains of the Black Inferno</em>. The revenant strikes back with a magical attack, but it doesn&rsquo;t prevent Gray from hauling the revenant high in the air. He then summarily drops the foe.</li><li>The zombies keep coming. Two more of their number rush Gundren and deal some heavy blows. The dwarf is not looking good.</li><li>Gundren strikes back ferociously, but he is badly damaged and flubs his first attack. Though his second strike hits home, it is not enough. Multiple zombies close in.</li><li>Seeing the state of things, Horns heals the groups again. He then commands the owls to assault the revenant, who is harried with beak and talon, yet the revenant seems undamaged.</li><li>The flameskull shoots a flame ray at one of the owls. It then directs its flame sphere to strike Gray again.</li><li>Just before the zombies close in on Gundren, Val the earth elemental sweeps up and slams the monsters into the wall.</li><li>Finn says she will help the ghost find his dog if it helps her put out the fire. Shrugging, the ghost demonstrates its hands passing through the flames without effect. It says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back after I find some <em>body</em> to help.&rdquo;</li><li>Finn continues to put out more of the fire, forcing Magrin to help. When she gets too close to the flame, one of the Ioun stone given to her from <a href=/dnd/characters/gimble-the-diviner>Gimble</a> starts to glow. Finn activates the stone, which releases a modified version of <em>Absorb Elements</em>, allowing Finn to snuff out the flames as she rolls around the room.</li><li>The revenant again misty steps away from the Gray&rsquo;s chains and back onto the back of the dragon. It then sends an eldritch blast at Gray for good measure.</li><li>The ghost flies up through the ceiling and attempts to possess Gray. However, Gray feeling a rising bloodlust, lets out a huge howl, and throws the spirit out and back through the roof to the floor below.</li><li>Gray just barely fights off bloodlust. Frustrated by not being able to reach the dragon, he flies into the gaping hole in the wall to get out of line of sight for now.</li><li>The zombies continue shamble around without targets.</li><li>Gundren pulls out his heavy crossbow, spits a curse, and launches a bolt at the dragon, but it goes wide.</li><li>Horns directs some attacks at the flameskull and some owls to chase the dragon.</li><li>The flameskull strikes Finn with the flaming sphere. It then shoots a flame ray at Horns.</li><li>Val earthglides over to splat another zombie.</li><li>Seeing the flameskull bring back heavy memories for Finn. She falls into a rage, and the random magic surge empowers her chosen weapon, this time Magrin. In anger, Finn launches the shield towards the Flameskull with enough force to shatter the creature, which explodes in a ball of fire.</li></ul><h4 id=vengeance-redirected>Vengeance Redirected</h4><ul><li>Val is still off the field, and the revenant grows increasingly frustrated. Since it cannot strike Val directly, it decides to hurt Val through her friends. Looking over the field, the revenant sends three eldritch blasts at an already injured Gundren. One strikes true, but the dwarf still stands defiant.</li><li>Then, the dragon flies down and spews forth toxic miasma. When the area clears, we see Gundren has fallen. Grey is in bad shape, and Oneshoe is heavily damaged.</li><li>Oneshoe calls upon the healing light from her patron to heal Gray. She then retreats inside the manor and quaffs a healing potion.</li><li>Gray flies on the gryphon to close with the revenant atop the dragon, but he is not able to catch his foe. Desperate, Gray attempts to grapple the revenant but is unsuccessful.</li><li>Horns commands an owl to transfer the body of Gundren away from the fight. Horns quickly approaches and stuffs four goodberries down the dwarf&rsquo;s throat. Gundren sputters awake and asks what happened. Horns said there was a dragon, but that Gundren had fought valiantly. Gundren says, &ldquo;Damn straight, I did. Where is it?!&rdquo; And then the dwarf starts heading back on the field despite protests from Horns.</li><li>Horns again sends his owls after the revenant. This time, the orders are: rip him from his mount.</li></ul><h3 id=end-of-session-map>End of Session Map</h3><p><img src=/images/dnd/screen-shot-2023-04-12-at-11-45-26-pm.png alt="Screenshot 2023-04-12 at 11.45.26 PM 1.png"></p><h2 id=dramatis-personae>Dramatis Personae</h2><h3 id=the-party>The Party</h3><ul><li><a href=/dnd/characters/finn>Finn</a></li><li><a href=/dnd/characters/haeltin-var-astora>Gray</a></li><li><a href=/dnd/characters/horns>Horns</a></li><li><a href=/dnd/characters/oneshoe>Oneshoe</a></li><li><a href=/dnd/characters/val>Val</a></li></ul><h3 id=returning>Returning</h3><ul><li><a href=/dnd/npcs/gundren-rockseeker>Gundren</a></li><li>The Revenant</li></ul><h3 id=new>New</h3><h3 id=mentioned>Mentioned</h3><ul><li><a href=/dnd/npcs/tharden-rockseeker>Tharden Rockseeker</a></li><li><a href=/dnd/npcs/nundro-rockseeker>Nundro Rockseeker</a></li></ul><h2 id=quotations>Quotations</h2><ul><li><a href=/dnd/npcs/gundren-rockseeker>Gundren</a>: Let&rsquo;s fuckin&rsquo; go!
