However, despite this, Gray fully orients towards their location.</li><li>Feeling exposed, the figure drops the invisibility.</li><li>There stands a gnome, just over three-feet tall and with a familiar mess of spiky hair. Gimble has returned.</li><li>At first he appears to be much like the same gnome who left the party in Avernus, but a closer look reveals differences. The gnome now wears darker robes and is clutching a transparent staff in his right hand. His eyes seem wild as they dart about the room. Every few moments, his left hand twitches.</li><li>Gimble greets the party, but they seem a bit wary of him. Gimble says, &ldquo;Hi, Finn,&rdquo; and begins to approach, but she holds back at first. Then Not-Bailey blinks into the space, sniffs at Gimble, and then starts to pant happily, which deflates some of the tension. Gimble gives Finn a hug.</li><li>Oneshoe remains visibly suspicious.</li><li>Suddenly Zed mounts Bullwinkle, scoops up the returned gnome, and rides triumphantly around the room, much to the wizard&rsquo;s consternation.</li><li>Jumping down, Gimble asks the party what danger they are in. He explains that yesterday as he was studying his book, he saw some images in his book that appeared to be drawn by Finn and indicated they were in trouble. Finn produces <a href=/media/dnd/finns-drawings-to-gimble.pdf>the drawings that she had just made</a>. &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s what I saw,&rdquo; says the gnome.</li><li>He again asks what danger they are in. The party doesn&rsquo;t seem to have a cohesive answer.</li><li>Gimble addresses the group.</li><li>He apologizes for the manner in which he abandoned the party, describes his descent into paranoia, and ends with an impassioned speech about &ldquo;being tired of running.&rdquo; Gimble wants to seek out and deal with the dangers of the world.</li><li>Gray asks more about the details of what Gimble has been up to. Strangely, Gimble&rsquo;s recollection of events goes foggy when Gray asks about the messenger he sent to the Hells. Gimble does not seem to remember <a href=/dnd/characters/rinnthalas-liadon>Rinn&rsquo;thalas</a>.</li></ul><h3 id=finding-direction>Finding Direction</h3><ul><li>The party discusses the various dangers they are aware of, including Gimble and <a href=/dnd/npcs/nyx>Nyx</a>&rsquo;s pursuers, the plot of The Wolves, the Shard of Mystra, <a href=/dnd/characters/val>Val</a>&rsquo;s abyssal note, and the rising power of Winter in the Feywild.</li></ul><h3 id=some-kind-of-plan>Some Kind of Plan</h3><ul><li>They decide to investigate The Wolves. Gimble recommends traveling to Candlekeep to find what they can on the Shard of Mystra and the Wolves, themselves. Further, he floats the idea of doing this very openly, hoping to bait the pursuers into revealing themselves.</li><li>Gimble sends a message to <a href=/dnd/npcs/nyx>Nyx</a>, who had been scrying on the group. He asks what she thinks. Nyx tries to dissuade Gimble from going directly after the pursuers, stating it is foolish. She has been doing this a long time and knows better. Gimble doesn&rsquo;t back down, but Nyx will not join in.</li><li>The party decides to go through with the plan. Gimble sends a message to <a href=/dnd/npcs/cassandra-belacourt>Cassandra Belacourt</a> informing her of the party&rsquo;s intention to meet her at Candlekeep and the fact that they may have some hostile pursuers at their back.</li><li>As the party makes preparations, Gimble decides to scry on the pursuer to get more information before they head out.</li></ul><h2 id=dramatis-personae>Dramatis Personae</h2><h3 id=the-party>The Party</h3><ul><li><a href=/dnd/characters/finn>Finn</a><ul><li>Not-Bailey</li></ul></li><li><a href=/dnd/characters/haeltin-var-astora>Gray</a></li><li><a href=/dnd/characters/horns>Horns</a><ul><li><a href=/dnd/npcs/psithyron>Psithyron</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=/dnd/characters/oneshoe>Oneshoe</a></li><li><a href=/dnd/characters/val>Val</a></li><li><a href=/dnd/characters/zed>Zed</a><ul><li>Bullwinkle</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id=returning>Returning</h3><ul><li><a href=/dnd/npcs/cassandra-belacourt>Cassandra Belacourt</a></li><li><a href=/dnd/characters/gimble-the-diviner>Gimble</a></li><li><a href=/dnd/npcs/nyx>Nyx</a></li></ul><h3 id=new>New</h3><h3 id=mentioned>Mentioned</h3><ul><li><a href=/dnd/npcs/caerwyn-cadogan>Caerwyn</a></li><li><a href=/dnd/npcs/queen-titania>Queen Titania</a></li><li><a href=/dnd/npcs/raeneth-var-astora>Raeneth</a></li><li><a href=/dnd/characters/rinnthalas-liadon>Rinn&rsquo;thalas</a></li><li><a href=/dnd/npcs/the-wolves>The Wolves</a></li></ul><h2 id=quotations>Quotations</h2><h2 id=inventory>Inventory</h2><h2 id=trivia>Trivia</h2><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://tlake.io/>&copy; Tanner Lake 2024</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
