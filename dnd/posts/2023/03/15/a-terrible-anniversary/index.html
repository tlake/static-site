The Revenant only gets in a few shots before Val shifts into an <em>Earth Elemental</em> and sinks into the ground, employing guerrilla tactics from below. <a href=/dnd/characters/oneshoe>Oneshoe</a> evades the patchwork horror and then dispatches it from the shadows. <a href=/dnd/characters/finn>Finn</a> argues with a ghost. Meanwhile in the basement, a breathless Gray wrestles with a rusalka, but <a href=/dnd/npcs/gundren-rockseeker>Gundren Rockseeker</a> comes to his aid! <a href=/dnd/characters/horns>Horns</a> shifts into a <em>Water Elemental</em> and holds off the brunt of the zombie horde on his own. Eventually overwhelmed, Horns responds by summoning a parliament of giant owls which carry him above the fray, just as a violent storm apparates around him and casts him to the ground. The battlefield is in chaos. Gray seizes this moment to perform a flying leap at the revenant atop its dragon mount!</p><h2 id=synopsis>Synopsis</h2><h3 id=recap>Recap</h3><p>The party spends an afternoon in deep discussion trying to make sense of the recent events and the direction they should choose. Choosing to abstain from the conversation, Gray instead retires to the basement to blow off some steam getting drunk and fighting training dummies until passing out from exhaustion. Late into the night, Gray wakes to receive an ominous warning from a raven just before being dragged underwater by a horrifying creature. At the same time, there is an explosion above where Horns was sleeping. Finn barely repels a possession, OneShoe is menaced by a patchwork horror, and Val rushes to the window to gauge the threat. Outside the smoldering wall of Tresendar Manor, a small army of undead approach, led by a figure with a singular intent.</p><h3 id=events>Events</h3><h4 id=undead-assault-tresendar-manor>Undead Assault Tresendar Manor</h4><ul><li>The revenant has returned to find <a href=/dnd/characters/val>Val</a>, and Tresendar Manor is besieged by a small army of undead.</li><li>Meanwhile in the basement, <a href=/dnd/characters/haeltin-var-astora>Gray</a> is alone and struggling to free himself from a watery death, and none of his companions are aware of his peril. Suddenly, a familiar dwarf runs in from the secret entrance. <a href=/dnd/npcs/gundren-rockseeker>G-Rock</a> has shown up to help defend Tresendar Manor!</li><li>Up above, Val responds to the thread by summoning an <em>Ice Storm</em> over the horde of zombies and the revenant atop the dragon.</li><li>The revenant extends a hand and casts a <em>Hex</em> on Val. He follows this up by several bolts of <em>Eldritch Blast</em> against the druid.</li><li><a href=/dnd/characters/finn>Finn</a> and the ghost try to have a conversation and end up confusing each other.</li><li>With great effort, Gray successfully escapes from the rusalka. He calls out for help from Gundren.</li><li>Gundren charges forward and casts a crossbow bolt at the drowned maiden.</li><li><a href=/dnd/characters/horns>Horns</a> casts darkness on the enemies and then transforms into a water elemental. His new form surges forth and lays into the incoming zombies.</li><li>The flameskull casts a few fire rays at Horns in his water elemental form.</li><li>Back in the basement, the rusalka attempts to ensnare Gray&rsquo;s mind and bring him back beneath the water, but he shakes off the attempt. However, before he can respond, the rusalka slinks back into the brackish water and disappears entirely.</li><li>Upstairs, Val does a cool &ldquo;Dukes of Hazard&rdquo;-style slide down the bannister to get down to the first floor; she then goes outside, shifts into an earth elemental and earth glides beneath the ground.</li><li>Back in Finn&rsquo;s room, the halfling still continues to confuse the ghost, or the other way around.</li><li>Though Val is nowhere to be seen, the revenant has come far and will not be denied. The creature taps into a deep well of hatred and somehow it is able to orient towards the hidden form of Val beneath the earth.</li><li>The revenant directs its dragon mount to close in on the ground Val is hidden beneath. As it waits for the reappearance of the druid, the revenant sends an eldritch blast through the window towards <a href=/dnd/characters/oneshoe>Oneshoe</a>. Luckily it misses the gnome as her attention is fixed on the disfigured creature lunging at her!</li><li>Not liking her situation, OneShoe flips on her aviators, disengages from the patchwork zombie, slides out of the room, and climbs up the wall with her <em>Slippers of Spider Climbing</em> to hide in the shadows.</li><li>Gray carefully approaches the cistern again and tries to use his preternatural senses to guess the location of the rusalka. He strikes suddenly with his <em>Chains of the Black Inferno</em>, and he finds his target! The rusalka had crept unnoticed just a few feet before him.</li><li>With his opponent now restrained, Gray continues his attack.</li><li>Back above, The zombie horde closes in on Horns and attacks, but they find it difficult to damage his watery form.</li><li>Gundren comes to Grays aid and strikes the foe mightily with his axe.</li><li>The patchwork monster completely loses track of OneShoe. It walks into hallway dumbfounded and loses its rage.</li><li>Horns as a water elemental covers several of the zombies. One of them becomes restrained and then stops moving entirely.</li><li>Back in the basement, the bound rusalka attempts to cast <em>Suggestion</em> on Gray, but his will is too strong. He resists.</li><li>Above, the dragon lets out a gout of foul necrotic power which weakens the water elemental and also destroys a zombie in the process.</li><li>OneShoe comes out of hiding just long enough to throw her new Boomerang of Awesomeness at the patchwork zombie. She strikes a mighty blow that also triggers a flash of magic that blinds the creature. Satisfied, the gnome moves further along and hides again.</li><li>Gray continues his assault against the rusalka.</li><li>The zombie horde closes in on Horns again, but his watery form proves too slick for their grasping strikes to find much purchase.</li><li>Down at the cistern, Gundren bellows, &ldquo;Get your hands off of Gray!&rdquo; He strikes ferociously before fully beheading the watery creature.</li><li>Back on the second floor, the patchwork monster blinded by OneShoe falls down the stairs to the first floor. OneShoe dispatches it later from a distance.</li><li>Horns the water elemental continues to wash over and destroy more zombies.</li><li>Val the earth elemental senses her moment and reaches up to attack a zombie from beneath the ground.</li><li>Unfortunately, the revenant was waiting for that moment, and it strikes her with a torrent of eldritch blasts.</li><li>The dragon then swoops down to attack Horns.</li><li>Finally tired of the conversation, the ghost tries again to possess Finn, but it finds that she seems to have become immune.</li><li>With their foe dispatched, Gray and Gundren rush upstairs.</li><li>The zombie horde again attempts to crash into Horns-water-elemental. This time, the group does enough damage to knock him out of his form.</li><li>Horns casts <em>Conjure Animals</em> to conjure 16 giant owls. The area is now full of birds.</li><li>The flameskull attacks.</li><li>Val earthglides up to attack more zombies.</li><li>The dragon rears up and roars at the owls, causing a great number to recoil in fear.</li><li>The ghost leaves Finn and flies up through the roof to survey the scene. It casts <em>Sleet Storm</em> at the group of owls.</li><li>OneShoe creeps along the roof to get a better view of the battle.</li><li>Gray climbs up the wall and then jumps in the air to attack the revenant atop its dragon mount!</li><li>The zombies shuffle and fall in the sleet storm.</li><li>Gundren drops a zombie and then throws a handaxe at the zombie dragon, which lands a solid hit.</li><li>Horn gets caught up in the sleet storm. He falls off the owl to the ground but is able to crawl his way out of the blinding area.</li><li>Five of his owls cannot keep up with the ferocious wind and sleet; they fall to the ground. A few make it out of the storm, and some manage to resist the fear of the dragon.</li></ul><h3 id=end-of-session-map>End of Session Map</h3><p><img src=/images/dnd/screenshot-2023-03-16-at-12-05-50-am.png alt="Screenshot 2023-03-16 at 12.05.50 AM.png"></p><h2 id=dramatis-personae>Dramatis Personae</h2><h3 id=the-party>The Party</h3><ul><li><a href=/dnd/characters/finn>Finn</a></li><li><a href=/dnd/characters/haeltin-var-astora>Gray</a></li><li><a href=/dnd/characters/horns>Horns</a></li><li><a href=/dnd/characters/oneshoe>Oneshoe</a></li><li><a href=/dnd/characters/val>Val</a></li></ul><h3 id=returning>Returning</h3><ul><li><a href=/dnd/npcs/gundren-rockseeker>Gundren</a></li><li>The Revenant</li></ul><h3 id=new>New</h3><h3 id=mentioned>Mentioned</h3><h2 id=quotations>Quotations</h2><h2 id=inventory>Inventory</h2><h2 id=trivia>Trivia</h2><h2 id=references>References</h2><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://tlake.io/>&copy; Tanner Lake 2024</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
