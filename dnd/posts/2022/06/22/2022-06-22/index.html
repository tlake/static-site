However, suddenly Val shifts into a giant eagle and takes off towards the north with all attempts to stop her in vain. A moment later, there is a deafening sound of destruction from the center of the city as a huge tidal wave destroys several of the bridges across the river, laying waste to many houses and lives in the process. With Val out of sight, the party fears she may be in danger. However, it is Val herself, empowered by Graz&rsquo;zt, who is bringing chaos and ruin to the city. And she is only beginning.</p><h2 id=synopsis>Synopsis</h2><h3 id=recap>Recap</h3><p>Having spent a night of various degrees of frivolity celebrating <a href=/dnd/characters/horns>Horns</a>&rsquo; exoneration, the party prepares to sail back down the River Styx to Avernus. Meanwhile, <a href=/dnd/characters/rinnthalas-liadon>Rinn&rsquo;thalas</a> sneaks off on his own to track a rumor through some of the lower layers. Arriving on the first layer, Gray gives Val the scroll of <em>Plane Shift</em> to return home, but Graz&rsquo;zt takes over and sends them to the Argent palace in the Abyss instead! Fighting against the demon lord&rsquo;s control, Val uses her borrowed power to cast <em>Plane Shift</em> again, sending party back to the material plane as the laughter of the demon prince echoes in their wake.</p><h3 id=events>Events</h3><h4 id=gone-in-6-seconds>Gone in 6 Seconds</h4><ul><li><a href=/dnd/characters/rinnthalas-liadon>Rinn&rsquo;thalas</a> asks <a href=/dnd/characters/val>Val</a> how she is feeling, and if she is able to resist the control of Graz&rsquo;zt.</li><li>Val says she is fine and suddenly jumps into the air, wild-shaping into a giant eagle.</li><li><a href=/dnd/characters/haeltin-var-astora>Gray</a> (as old man disguise) tries to put a blood-curse of binding on Val, unsuccessfully.</li><li><a href=/dnd/characters/horns>Horns</a> for some reason tries to cast <em>Conjure Animals</em>, but he is counterspelled by Val, somehow.</li><li><a href=/dnd/characters/finn>Finn</a> tries to use the distraction to steal <a href=/dnd/npcs/magrin>Magrin</a> back from <a href=/dnd/characters/horns>Horns</a>, unsuccessfully.</li></ul><h4 id=tidal-wave>Tidal Wave</h4><ul><li>Val, or what is in control of Val, drops down the street, drops wild shape and casts an (incredibly powerful) Tidal Wave to assault the three bridges.<ul><li>The rest of the party are not aware of Val&rsquo;s actions.</li></ul></li><li>The wave takes out several bridges and the people on them.
