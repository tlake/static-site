They find a room with six pillars, adorned with piles of teeth&ndash;apparently some ghastly connection to <a href=/dnd/npcs/gelfondi>Gelfondi</a>&rsquo;s machine room found earlier. Despite <a href=/dnd/characters/oneshoe>Oneshoe</a>&rsquo;s best efforts, <a href=/dnd/characters/rinnthalas-liadon>Rinn&rsquo;thalas</a> proves a hindrance to their joint investigative efforts. Alone, <a href=/dnd/characters/haeltin-var-astora>Gray</a> does his best to efficiently and silently search the remaining rooms, but this is soon interrupted by some locker room antics from <a href=/dnd/characters/zed>Zed</a> and his herd of minotaur berserkers. Without Rinn&rsquo;s distraction, Oneshoe focuses and successfully disarms an intricate needle trap at the entrance of yet another torture chamber. Within, they find a certain dwarf, gravely injured and pleading for help. Just as the party has their objective in hand, the keen senses of the summoned wolf pack pick up sounds from the south&ndash;an approaching elevator. Frantic, the party dashes for the closest means of escape, just as a growing illumination looms from the southern corridor. Over her shoulder, Oneshoe can just make out a figure in the distance, an imperious beauty wreathed in orange-white flame. <a href=/dnd/npcs/fierna>Fierna</a> has arrived.</p><h2 id=synopsis>Synopsis</h2><h3 id=recap>Recap</h3><blockquote><p><a href=/dnd/posts/2022-02-16>2022-02-16 Import Campaign</a></p><p>Alone and defiant, <a href=/dnd/characters/finn>Finn</a> squares up against the incoming bone devil and its guard. She is swiftly restrained by a chain devil, and Finn summons her signature flumphs in retribution, but this does not stop the bone devil from savagely attacking Finn with its claws and hideous stinger. Meanwhile, <a href=/dnd/npcs/gelfondi>Gelfondi</a> falls beneath a mountain of minotaurs and a wicked blight spell from <a href=/dnd/characters/val>Val</a>. The party comes to Finn&rsquo;s aid, empowering her with protective magic as they join the battle. In a rage, Finn breaks free of the chains and climbs <em>atop the bone devil</em> to continue her attack. <a href=/dnd/characters/horns>Horns</a> summons a wolf pack and wild shapes into a giant elk to lead them in a charge. Seizing the moment, <a href=/dnd/characters/zed>Zed</a> mounts giant elk-Horns and smites the bone devil mightily while his minotaur berserkers join the chaotic melee. Against the Menagerie&rsquo;s signature flood of creatures, the devils have little chance and the western corridor is soon cleared.</p></blockquote><h3 id=events>Events</h3><h4 id=battle-aftermath>Battle Aftermath</h4><ul><li>The machine in the center of the machine room is made out of some sort of green material.

It has pile of teeth on it.</li><li>Oneshoe and Rinn return to <a href=/dnd/npcs/gelfondi>Gelfondi</a>&rsquo;s bedroom to find the notes on the machine.

Oneshoe tries to instruct the hapless Rinn.</li><li>Rinn manages to find some pieces of garbage.</li><li>With little effort, Oneshoe finds a small vial with glints of gold flecking in it.</li><li>Meanwhile, Gray stealthily peeks in the western &ldquo;TP hole&rdquo;. He sees a lot of older, broken down furniture and equipment.</li><li>Gray does notice some movement underneath a pile of towels in the corner of the room, but he decides this is not worth his time. He begins to quietly close the door.</li></ul><h4 id=locker-room-towel-fight>Locker Room Towel Fight</h4><ul><li>Suddenly Zed and his minotaurs bust into the room.</li><li>The minotaurs grab the old shreds of fabric from the pile and begin snapping towels at each other.</li><li>This reveals some small monsters underfoot, who attack!</li><li>Gray lashes out at one of them from the doorway.</li><li>Some of the small arthropods leap and attach to a few of the berserkers.</li><li>Zed and the minotaurs fight it out and work to squash the bugs.</li><li>Zed calls out for help, but Gray says, &ldquo;You got this,&rdquo; and shuts the door.</li><li>One carrion stalker burrows into a berserkers arm, twitches, and then a cloud of larvae explode outwards and poison several nearby minotaurs.</li><li>Zed slaps one of the poisoned minotaurs and says, &ldquo;You got this, bro,&rdquo; removing the poison from one.</li><li>Eventually victorious, one of the minotaurs exits the room and slaps Gray on the back, saying, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s ok to be scared, bro.&rdquo;</li></ul><h4 id=exploring-the-pillar-room>Exploring the Pillar Room</h4><ul><li>Rinn peers into the pillar room. He doesn&rsquo;t see much. He asks Zed to see if he can reveal any invisible enemies.</li><li>Rinn keeps his distance from the herd.</li><li>Instead of waiting, the herd just forces its way into the room, pulling most of the party with it.</li><li>They don&rsquo;t find much within, except the six pillars, some of which have piles of teeth upon them.</li><li>Gray listens at the norther door.

It seems to match the description of <a href=/dnd/npcs/magrin>Magrin</a>.</li><li>Gray enters the room, tells Zed to keep Rinn out, and then closes the door.i</li><li>Meanwhile, Rinn is posted up in the corridor keeping watch.</li><li>Zed makes a fair bit of noise in the Pillar room. Rinn hears this faintly from his position, so he starts to come back to investigate.</li><li>In the room, Gray and Oneshoe remove gag from the dwarf. They find that all of his teeth have been removed.</li><li>Gray asks the dwarf, &ldquo;You speak common?&rdquo;</li><li>The dwarf tries to respond, but he is in terrible shape and hard to understand. Mostly he asks, &ldquo;Please help.&rdquo;</li><li>Gray lays the special coin from <a href=/dnd/npcs/ignaroz>Ignaroz</a> atop the withered dwarf, and then runs him through with his star saber. The dwarf expires, and the soul coins warms with its new occupant.</li><li>The party now has the means to fulfill <a href=/dnd/notes/tymphals-contract>Tymphal&rsquo;s Contract</a>, if they can escape the tower.</li></ul><h4 id=a-hasty-escape>A Hasty Escape</h4><ul><li>Curious about the noise from earlier, Rinn&rsquo;thalas tries to enter the pillar room, but the minotaurs restrain him from going anywhere.</li><li>Meanwhile, Horn&rsquo;s wolf pack alerts and cocks their ears towards the southern corridor.</li><li>It seems the elevator is approaching this floor.
