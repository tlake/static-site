Fires rage at the ports and southwestern fields, but the city begins to mobilize a response. <a href=/dnd/characters/oneshoe>Oneshoe</a> attempts to acquire more reinforcements from her patron and the city leadership. <a href=/dnd/characters/finn>Finn</a> channels aggression into a one-halfling fire brigade. Within the prison of her mind, Val struggles to resist Graz&rsquo;zt&rsquo;s control. <a href=/dnd/characters/rinnthalas-liadon>Rinn&rsquo;thalas</a> spots a more fiendish form of Val as she cuts down a guard on a distant battlement, and he sends off a report to headquarters before pursuing his target. <a href=/dnd/characters/haeltin-var-astora>Gray</a> tracks Val to her last location, but his heightened senses determine that she has completely disappeared.</p><h2 id=synopsis>Synopsis</h2><h3 id=recap>Recap</h3><p>The party finds themselves back in Neverwinter, just outside the arcane college where <a href=/dnd/npcs/elian-amaadon>Master Elian Amaadon</a> should be able to help cure <a href=/dnd/characters/val>Val</a> of the demonic influence. However, suddenly Val shifts into a giant eagle and takes off towards the north with all attempts to stop her in vain. A moment later, there is a deafening sound of destruction from the center of the city as a huge tidal wave destroys several of the bridges across the river, laying waste to many houses and lives in the process. With Val out of sight, the party fears she may be in danger. However, it is Val herself, empowered by Graz&rsquo;zt, who is bringing chaos and ruin to the city. And she is only beginning.</p><h3 id=events>Events</h3><h4 id=oneshoes-unicorn-dance-off>Oneshoe&rsquo;s Unicorn Dance-off</h4><ul><li>Oneshoe does a flash mob K-pop event to call out to Mooncolor.

Though at a great distance, Rinn was just able to make out the darkening form of Graz&rsquo;zt/Val as they laid into the doomed guard on the battlements before disappearing from view. With a curse, Rinn spurs his owl towards the retreating form.</li><li>As Rinn flies towards Val&rsquo;s location, he reaches up and shakes out an amulet from beneath his armor. It looks like a&mldr;maybe a torus, but broken in two, perhaps. He grasps it and shuts his eyes for a moment. Then he opens them suddenly and says:</li></ul><blockquote><p>Urgent.
