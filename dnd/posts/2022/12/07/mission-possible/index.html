The party meets an old contact at a seedy nightclub, and <a href=/dnd/characters/haeltin-var-astora>Gray</a> uses this opportunity to reacquaint himself with drink and companionship. Back at the mage college, <a href=/dnd/characters/rinnthalas-liadon>Rinn&rsquo;thalas</a> explains the delicate situation that <a href=/dnd/characters/val>Val</a> is in and recruits <a href=/dnd/npcs/elian-amaadon>Master Elian</a> as a contact for The Vigil to keep an eye on her welfare. <a href=/dnd/characters/zed>Zed</a> tries to redirect a growing sense of aggression by joining the local fight rings. Just before Rinn plans to leave to debrief his superiors on Graz&rsquo;zt&rsquo;s attack, Gray asks the party to assist him with looking into reports of local Dragon Cult activity, which turns out to be much more than it would seem.</p><h2 id=synopsis>Synopsis</h2><h3 id=recap>Recap</h3><p>With <a href=/dnd/characters/val>Val</a> finally subdued, <a href=/dnd/npcs/elian-amaadon>Master Elian Amaadon</a> teleports most of the party to the Mage College to begin the difficult work of attempting to remove Graz&rsquo;zt&rsquo;s control over the wayward druid. Meanwhile, <a href=/dnd/characters/rinnthalas-liadon>Rinn&rsquo;thalas</a> notices an unseasonal snowfall as he confronts <a href=/dnd/npcs/unidius>Unidius</a>. Days pass, <a href=/dnd/characters/finn>Finn</a> explores the local temples seeking guidance; <a href=/dnd/characters/haeltin-var-astora>Gray</a> covertly handles a few things on his own in Neverwinter; <a href=/dnd/characters/horns>Horns</a> assists the local druids in repairing the damage from the attack; and Rinn&rsquo;thalas stands guard over an unconscious Val. When the druid finally awakens, she claims to be free of Graz&rsquo;zt but has foul tidings for the party.</p><h3 id=events>Events</h3><h4 id=information-gathering>Information Gathering</h4><ul><li><a href=/dnd/characters/oneshoe>Oneshoe</a> asks around for some things.<ul><li>She asks <a href=/dnd/characters/rinnthalas-liadon>Rinn&rsquo;thalas</a> about Sigil.</li><li>Rinn stated that he would look into the &ldquo;Cause and Effect&rdquo; maker&rsquo;s mark that <a href=/dnd/npcs/elian-amaadon>Master Elian Amaadon</a> identified as connected to the steel defender attack.</li><li>Oneshoe tracks down a temple to the sea to ask about the anomaly of the weather.<ul><li>The temple is in the Marina District in western Neverwinter.</li><li>The Marina District is largely ruined after having been flooded to put out the fires caused by Val&rsquo;s rampage; buildings are unstable, boats are beached.</li><li>She enters a combination sailor&rsquo;s temple and dockhouse to chat up a salty old seadog, asks him if he knows where the snow&rsquo;s coming from.</li><li>&ldquo;The sky&rdquo; is his answer; it turns out the source of a freak snowstorm is a mystery to this sailor.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>OneShoe catches some of the falling snow in a vial and cobbles together a rudimentary alchemist kit from her poisoner&rsquo;s kit, and after some experimentation she discovers that it is, in fact, mundane snow.</li></ul><h4 id=losing-innocence-at-jeffersons-bar>Losing Innocence at Jefferson&rsquo;s Bar</h4><ul><li>Oneshoe then goes towards the docks to talk to Jefferson to inquire further about the strange snow in Neverwinter.<ul><li>Jefferson has a side piece next to him named Innocence.</li><li>They chat congenially for a bit as Oneshoe gets sloshed on a single <em>Hell and Back</em> cocktail.</li><li>Jefferson thinks the snow is weird, but he doesn&rsquo;t know why.</li></ul></li><li><a href=/dnd/characters/haeltin-var-astora>Gray</a> sits down and starts to work on a drink.

He explains that this is the same organization that Unidius is (kinda) pledged to, and that if Master E were to commit himself to the Vigil and to the supervision of Val, they would be amenable to not hunting her down.</li><li>Additionally, it would be much appreciated to have an operative in the city who isn&rsquo;t <a href=/dnd/npcs/unidius>Unidius</a>.</li><li>Master E agrees after explaining that he cannot commit the resources of the <a href=/dnd/locations/mage-college>Mage&rsquo;s College</a> to the Vigil, and Rinn inducts him by giving him a nascent Amulet of the Vigil, part of the modified <em>sending stone</em> that Rinn uses to communicate with his order.</li><li>We learn here that Elian&rsquo;s last name is Amaadon, which means &ldquo;silverflower.&rdquo;</li></ul></li></ul><h4 id=zeds-shenanigans>Zed&rsquo;s Shenanigans</h4><ul><li>A wild <a href=/dnd/characters/zed>Zed</a> appears.</li><li>He seems to have been feeling on edge since the Hells.</li><li>Zed tries to let out aggression by joining the local fighting rings and fiercely doing yoga.</li></ul><h4 id=grays-partying>Gray&rsquo;s Partying</h4><ul><li>A very inebriated Gray brings some of the performers back from Jefferson&rsquo;s Bar to the mage college.</li><li>Their carousing is a large factor in the party getting kicked out from staying at the college post-recovery of Val.</li></ul><h4 id=investigating-rumors-of-dragon-cult-activity>Investigating Rumors of Dragon Cult Activity</h4><ul><li>Just as Rinn prepares to leave to return to the council of The Vigil, Gray remembers that he is supposed to check out possible Cult of the Dragon activity at a remote farm outside of Neverwinter.</li><li>He asks the party to come with him on his investigation.</li><li>Looks like the farm was damaged by fire many years back. It looks abandoned.</li><li>Rinn and Oneshoe scout ahead. They blend into the shadows and notice a beefy orc hiding deep in the corner of the silo oriented to look towards the road.</li><li>The pair retreat a distance on an oblique angle to watch the door, and Rinn signals Gray via the <em>Horn of Silent Alarm</em>.</li></ul><h4 id=gray-calls-out-the-hidden-figure>Gray Calls Out the Hidden Figure</h4><ul><li>Gray susses out the situation. He asks Horns and Zed to retreat up the road as if they are leaving him. He tells them to make sure they don&rsquo;t get away.</li><li>Gray shifts his disguise from the old man he had been wearing to another form - that of the late Gray.</li><li>Seemingly alone, Gray makes a show of examining the farmhouse, but there is no response.</li><li>He then walks towards the silo, with again no response.</li><li>Walking yet closer, he calls out to the hidden figure, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a fan of games.&rdquo; His accent has changed.</li><li>No response for awhile. Finally the figure talks. They say they are interested in talking.</li><li>There is some banter. The hidden figure boasts that Gray may not be the one to do his job.</li><li>Suddenly Gray is hit with some force that assaults his senses, but Gray shakes it off.</li><li>Finally, a figure emerges, a full-blooded orc. Gray recognizes her: a woman named Mountain, a wrathful inquisitor bearing a big fucking axe.</li><li>They trade some barbs.</li><li>Gray knows this person, and asks why they are here. He also said, &ldquo;Mother has already voiced her displeasure towards me.&rdquo;</li><li>The figure says that Gray has been difficult to track.</li><li>The Mountain says, &ldquo;Try not to stay away too long. Big things are afoot. You might want to be home for them.&rdquo;</li><li>Supposedly &ldquo;months away&rdquo; from something big.</li><li>The Mountain asks Gray if they should catch up, and he says sure.</li><li>She approaches him and they make to walk toward Neverwinter together.</li></ul><h4 id=and-then-there-was-zed>And Then There Was Zed</h4><ul><li>Meanwhile, Zed, astride Bullwinkle, climbs up a tree on an angle to form a gigantic orcish/elkish flag.</li><li>The Mountain sees this and is dumbfounded. After a beat, she says, &ldquo;What the hell?&rdquo; or something to that effect. She then motions to continue walking with Gray towards the city.</li><li>Zed then remembers that Gray had told him not to let the quarry get away, so Zed decides to charge the Mountain with his lance.
