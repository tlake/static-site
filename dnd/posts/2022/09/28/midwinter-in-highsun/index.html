Meanwhile, <a href=/dnd/characters/rinnthalas-liadon>Rinn&rsquo;thalas</a> notices an unseasonal snowfall as he confronts <a href=/dnd/npcs/unidius>Unidius</a>. Days pass, <a href=/dnd/characters/finn>Finn</a> explores the local temples seeking guidance; <a href=/dnd/characters/haeltin-var-astora>Gray</a> covertly handles a few things on his own in Neverwinter; <a href=/dnd/characters/horns>Horns</a> assists the local druids in repairing the damage from the attack; and Rinn&rsquo;thalas stands guard over an unconscious Val. When the druid finally awakens, she claims to be free of Graz&rsquo;zt but has foul tidings for the party.</p><h2 id=synopsis>Synopsis</h2><h3 id=recap>Recap</h3><p><a href=/dnd/characters/val>Val</a> continues her internal fight with <a href=/dnd/npcs/grazzt>Graz&rsquo;zt</a> for control. The party finds it difficult to track their friend as she repeatedly teleports around Neverwinter. Finally sighting Val at a distance, <a href=/dnd/characters/rinnthalas-liadon>Rinn&rsquo;thalas</a> shows no hesitation in committing to a lethal assault. <a href=/dnd/npcs/the-vigil>The Vigil</a> sends word that an infamous operative has been tasked to remove the threat. Finally, thanks to information gathered by <a href=/dnd/characters/oneshoe>Oneshoe</a>, <a href=/dnd/npcs/elian-amaadon>Master Elian</a> is able to teleport the party near Val&rsquo;s location. They race to subdue the wayward druid peacefully before either she destroys more lives or loses her own in the process.</p><h3 id=events>Events</h3><h4 id=val-loses-consciousness>Val Loses Consciousness</h4><ul><li>As <a href=/dnd/characters/val>Val</a> loses consciousness after <a href=/dnd/characters/haeltin-var-astora>Gray</a> struck her with the <em>Dagger of Feign Death</em>, she comes face to face with Graz&rsquo;zt in her mind.</li><li>She immediately tries to punch the demon prince, but he dodges easily, taunting her continuously.</li><li>Graz&rsquo;zt toys with Val and claims that she will lose his gifts if <a href=/dnd/npcs/elian-amaadon>Master Elian Amaadon</a> succeeds in helping Val.</li><li>Graz&rsquo;zt&rsquo;s tries to influence Val by implied threats against her family, but she doesn&rsquo;t buy it.</li><li>Val tries to conjure a box within her mind to imprison Graz&rsquo;zt, but he cannot be so easily contained.</li><li>Graz&rsquo;zt keeps insinuating that her abyssal predilection &ldquo;runs in her blood&rdquo;.</li></ul><h4 id=master-elian-takes-val-the-mage-university>Master Elian Takes Val the Mage University</h4><ul><li>He says that they will try to cure Val, but that the party isn&rsquo;t needed.
