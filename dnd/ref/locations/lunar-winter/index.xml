The nautiloids rain drop-pods down on the party, and they must contend with a host of intellect devourers, ceremorphs, and the mutated results of illithid experimentation on abducted creatures; an elder brain dragon even makes an appearance. Finn follows the advice of the lunar deity in her mind and peels a sliver off the moon like an apple. As the tides of battle shift in favor of the illithid invasion, a frigid tempest builds on the horizon and rushes towards the group at alarming speed. Moments later the ice storm arrives, lightning flashing and ice crashing all around them as the rider of storm makes herself known: it is Mab, the Queen of Air and Darkness, and she immediately engages with the elder brain dragon.</description></item><item><title>Playing Chicken With a Dragon</title><link>https://tlake.io/dnd/posts/2025/05/28/playing-chicken-with-a-dragon/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2025 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://tlake.io/dnd/posts/2025/05/28/playing-chicken-with-a-dragon/</guid><description>The Menagerie windwalk in search of the ancient white dragon that once had been a snow-covered hill. They&amp;rsquo;re successful in tracking it down, and talk it into landing. The party is split between trying to fight the dragon and trying to lie to the dragon, and eventually Gray is able to use the Heart of Winter to convince the dragon that they&amp;rsquo;re here at the behest of the Queen of Air and Darkness. They manage to convince the dragon to hand over the frozen form of Kellis and barely avoid being conscripted into whatever the dragon&amp;rsquo;s current purpose is, and it flies away to resume its quest. As the Menagerie begin the long trek back to the copse of trees, the dragon turns around and flies directly towards the party as a trio of nautiloid ships appear out of nowhere, as if dropping out of warp.</description></item><item><title>Queen Mab</title><link>https://tlake.io/dnd/npcs/queen-mab/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jan 2022 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://tlake.io/dnd/npcs/queen-mab/</guid><description>Import Campaign Characters
