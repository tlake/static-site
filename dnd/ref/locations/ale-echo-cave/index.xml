Val takes a weary Gundren out for drinks; Oneshoe tails Finn as she is pulled into a suspicious conversation with Brooke; Horns assesses the damage to his room; and Gray has a vision in the basement. The party finally comes together again the next afternoon, and Gray admits to the group: this has all been his fault, and he needs to leave. A great amount of discord follows. Help is sought from absent allies with unclear results. The party fights about direction but fails to reach any consensus.</description></item></channel></rss>
