I&amp;rsquo;ve had a Keybase account since 2011, and it&amp;rsquo;s become a bit of a disjointed mess. The addition and revocation of devices makes sense, since I&amp;rsquo;ve gone through a couple of phones since 2011. However, my usage of PGP keys has been erratic.
You see, my nebulous grasp of PGP keys roughly equated them with SSH keys, and so I&amp;rsquo;d created and revoked a few of them.</description></item></channel></rss>
