I&amp;rsquo;ve got them networked together in a Docker swarm, with mansionsyrup as the leader. One of the biggest responsibilities of mansionsyrup is to run a Traefik container, which handles routing traffic across my other Docker containers, wherever in the swarm they may be running.</description></item><item><title>Streaming to Discord on Linux: Managing audio streams via PulseAudio</title><link>https://tlake.io/blog/streaming-game-audio-to-discord-on-linux-with-pulseaudio/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Oct 2022 21:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://tlake.io/blog/streaming-game-audio-to-discord-on-linux-with-pulseaudio/</guid><description>As it turns out, streaming game audio to Discord isn&amp;rsquo;t trivial when you&amp;rsquo;re on Linux.
The Problem It seems like Discord&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Go Live&amp;rdquo; feature, which allows streaming both application audio and application video in addition to voice chat, doesn&amp;rsquo;t really exist on Linux? This means that I could share the visuals of a game that I&amp;rsquo;m playing and speak with friends in a Discord voice channel, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t also send the game audio across Discord to my friends who were tuning in.</description></item><item><title>spring cleaning my digital identity</title><link>https://tlake.io/blog/spring-cleaning-my-digital-identity/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Apr 2019 09:19:09 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://tlake.io/blog/spring-cleaning-my-digital-identity/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;d been reading up about git-secret and realized that I didn&amp;rsquo;t really grasp what a PGP key is or how to use one (or more). I&amp;rsquo;ve had a Keybase account since 2011, and it&amp;rsquo;s become a bit of a disjointed mess. The addition and revocation of devices makes sense, since I&amp;rsquo;ve gone through a couple of phones since 2011. However, my usage of PGP keys has been erratic.
You see, my nebulous grasp of PGP keys roughly equated them with SSH keys, and so I&amp;rsquo;d created and revoked a few of them.</description></item><item><title>the dns and deployment of tlake.io</title><link>https://tlake.io/blog/the-dns-and-deployment-of-tlake-io/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Apr 2019 09:19:09 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://tlake.io/blog/the-dns-and-deployment-of-tlake-io/</guid><description>Porkbun is my new favorite domain registrar and had the best deals on .io domains that I could find, but I wanted to use DNSimple to manage my DNS settings. DNSimple offers a robust API and a Terraform provider, which is very appealing to my infrastructure-as-code aspirations. Luckily, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty easy to get the best of both worlds:
Through Porkbun, replace the domain&amp;rsquo;s default nameservers with DNSimple&amp;rsquo;s nameservers.
Import the domain through DNSimple and bam!</description></item></channel></rss>
