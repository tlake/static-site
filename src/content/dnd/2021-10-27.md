## Summary

After spending some time with the stone giant [Keith Stone](/dnd/characters/npcs/keith-stone/), the party continues gathering intel for their Caper at Fierna's Tower. They speak with [Melkor](/dnd/characters/npcs/melkor/) and later [Aeortis](/dnd/characters/npcs/aeortis/), who gives them detailed information about the tower's construction in exchange for a new contract to retrieve something extra from the tower. A letter is delivered to the party by a strange messenger.
