The current (and former) complement of The Menagerie can be found [here](characters).

I've pulled the early game's records from the dusty confines of an old postgres database and (for now) that unintegrated information can be found in [the archives](archive).

The middle game was not recorded, but I have at least the major plot points of how we got to where we are in my head, and at least one of the players has taken some notes.

Maybe I'll convert the big block of archives into backdated posts. Maybe I'll create some content for The Betweentimes.

Maybe.
