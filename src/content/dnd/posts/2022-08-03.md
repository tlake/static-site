## Summary

[Graz'zt](/dnd/npcs/grazzt/)/[Val](/dnd/characters/val/) continues her rampage through Neverwinter, ably avoiding view of the party, who is searching for Val from the skies atop gryphon and [Horns](/dnd/characters/horns/)' flock of giant owls. Fires rage at the ports and southwestern fields, but the city begins to mobilize a response. [Oneshoe](/dnd/characters/oneshoe/) attempts to acquire more reinforcements from her patron and the city leadership. [Finn](/dnd/characters/finn/) channels aggression into a one-halfling fire brigade. Within the prison of her mind, Val struggles to resist Graz'zt's control. [Rinn'thalas](/dnd/characters/rinnthalas-liadon/) spots a more fiendish form of Val as she cuts down a guard on a distant battlement, and he sends off a report to headquarters before pursuing his target. [Gray](/dnd/characters/haeltin-var-astora/) tracks Val to her last location, but his heightened senses determine that she has completely disappeared.

## Synopsis

### Recap

The party finds themselves back in Neverwinter, just outside the arcane college where [Master Elian Amaadon](/dnd/npcs/elian-amaadon/) should be able to help cure [Val](/dnd/characters/val/) of the demonic influence. However, suddenly Val shifts into a giant eagle and takes off towards the north with all attempts to stop her in vain. A moment later, there is a deafening sound of destruction from the center of the city as a huge tidal wave destroys several of the bridges across the river, laying waste to many houses and lives in the process. With Val out of sight, the party fears she may be in danger. However, it is Val herself, empowered by Graz'zt, who is bringing chaos and ruin to the city. And she is only beginning.

### Events

#### Oneshoe's Unicorn Dance-off

- Oneshoe does a flash mob K-pop event to call out to Mooncolor. Unfortunately, the call is not heard. Looked amazing though!

#### You All Get an Owl

- The party takes to the air, mostly on the backs of giant owls summoned by [Horns](/dnd/characters/horns/).
- Except for [Gray](/dnd/characters/haeltin-var-astora/), he has a gryphon. [Master Elian Amaadon](/dnd/npcs/elian-amaadon/) joins him and goes invisible. 
- They start flying towards the chaos at the docks.

#### Multiattack with...a bucket?

- [Finn](/dnd/characters/finn/) does her best to subdue the inferno at the docks by scooping up water in her *Pot of Awakening* and aggressively dousing the flames.

#### Neverwinter Response

- Some mages are are starting to mobilize.
- Patrons of the *Moonstone Mask* start a fire brigade to put out the fires.
- Sailors start to take out the remaining mephits at the docks, but not without casualties.
- Druids show up and summon a flood to put out much of the inferno at the docks and most of the fields in the southwest.

#### He's Too Old for this Shit

- Oneshoe hits up a contact in the Hall of Justice, Deputy Mayor Crandall. 
- She tries to establish some communication with a city-wide response, but it seems like those organizations are not quite online yet.

#### Just Nightcrawler Things

- [Val](/dnd/characters/val/), compelled by Graz'zt, has remained out of sight by rapidly bamfing (teleporting) a significant distance to the south, hugging the southwestern wall.
- Within her mind, Val is periodically trying to push back agains Graz'zt's control, and she occasionally breaks free.

#### He Was a Legend

- In a brief moment of clarity, Val sees a guard atop the wall, and attempts to charm him, but the spell fails. With her remain bit of free will, Val calls out to him, "Find Finn, and tell her where I am!"
- Unfortunately, Graz'zt again asserts control and teleports atop the wall to dispose of the loose ends.
- Amazingly, the guard fully avoids the first attack from the draconic greatsword!
- Graz'zt/Val charms the other nearby guard and convinces him to close the door to the nearby tower, cutting off the first guard's escape.
- Again, the draconic greatsword flies out, and the guard withstands the first assault, but he ultimately falls beneath the second strike.
- Val then directs her charmed friend to open the door as she descends the tower.

#### A Spark Remains

- Although resistance finally put down the rogue elementals at the ports, a sole mephit continues further east along the southern wall of the city, ~~blessing~~ burning fields along the way. 

#### Reporting to Headquarters

- Meanwhile, [Rinn](/dnd/characters/rinnthalas-liadon/) had directed his owl to rise to a significant elevation, scanning the city for sight of Val. Though at a great distance, Rinn was just able to make out the darkening form of Graz'zt/Val as they laid into the doomed guard on the battlements before disappearing from view. With a curse, Rinn spurs his owl towards the retreating form.
- As Rinn flies towards Val's location, he reaches up and shakes out an amulet from beneath his armor. It looks like a...maybe a torus, but broken in two, perhaps. He grasps it and shuts his eyes for a moment. Then he opens them suddenly and says:

> Urgent. Prime Toril Neverwinter.
> Class 2 Incursion.
> Graz'zt involved.
> Requesting assistance.
> Mass casualties central bridges.
> Hostile elementals portside.
> Tracking prime suspect.
> [Nadyantal'laval](/dnd/characters/val/).
> ...\[sigh\]
> Ze'brak protocol.

#### Difficult Quarry

- As the party fast approaches, Graz'zt/Val stops halfway down the staircase and decides to teleport to away, to the Temple of Sune.
- Gray arrives on scene to track Val, but his keen senses note that her scent abruptly stops midway down the tower. She is gone.

#### Struggle for Dominance

- Far away in the northeast of the city, Val still tries to wrest control back from a demon prince.
