## Summary

The party finds themselves back in Neverwinter, just outside the arcane college where [Master Elian Amaadon](/dnd/npcs/elian-amaadon/) should be able to help cure [Val](/dnd/characters/val/) of the demonic influence. However, suddenly Val shifts into a giant eagle and takes off towards the north with all attempts to stop her in vain. A moment later, there is a deafening sound of destruction from the center of the city as a huge tidal wave destroys several of the bridges across the river, laying waste to many houses and lives in the process. With Val out of sight, the party fears she may be in danger. However, it is Val herself, empowered by Graz'zt, who is bringing chaos and ruin to the city. And she is only beginning. 

## Synopsis

### Recap

Having spent a night of various degrees of frivolity celebrating [Horns](/dnd/characters/horns/)' exoneration, the party prepares to sail back down the River Styx to Avernus. Meanwhile, [Rinn'thalas](/dnd/characters/rinnthalas-liadon/) sneaks off on his own to track a rumor through some of the lower layers. Arriving on the first layer, Gray gives Val the scroll of *Plane Shift* to return home, but Graz'zt takes over and sends them to the Argent palace in the Abyss instead! Fighting against the demon lord's control, Val uses her borrowed power to cast *Plane Shift* again, sending party back to the material plane as the laughter of the demon prince echoes in their wake.

### Events

#### Gone in 6 Seconds

- [Rinn'thalas](/dnd/characters/rinnthalas-liadon/) asks [Val](/dnd/characters/val/) how she is feeling, and if she is able to resist the control of Graz'zt.
- Val says she is fine and suddenly jumps into the air, wild-shaping into a giant eagle.
- [Gray](/dnd/characters/haeltin-var-astora/) (as old man disguise) tries to put a blood-curse of binding on Val, unsuccessfully.
- [Horns](/dnd/characters/horns/) for some reason tries to cast *Conjure Animals*, but he is counterspelled by Val, somehow.
- [Finn](/dnd/characters/finn/) tries to use the distraction to steal [Magrin](/dnd/npcs/magrin/) back from [Horns](/dnd/characters/horns/), unsuccessfully.

#### Tidal Wave

- Val, or what is in control of Val, drops down the street, drops wild shape and casts an (incredibly powerful) Tidal Wave to assault the three bridges.
    - The rest of the party are not aware of Val's actions.
- The wave takes out several bridges and the people on them. Several old houses are also destroyed.

#### Aftermath

- Rinn'thalas calls out to the others to get "Master E" and then scales the nearest building, casts *Haste* on himself, and runs towards the sounds of destruction.
- Val sees Rinn'thalas in the distance, and teleports behind the walls of Castle Never.
- Horns summons a bunch of giant owls and flies to the Northwest (with Finn still holding onto Magrin, the shield).
- Rinn'thalas, not seeing Val, dashes towards the sounds of the destruction and gives a bunch of goodberries to several of the walking wounded to distribute to the casualties.
- Finn casts invisibility on herself and drops to the streets.
- Val enters Castle Never proper and goes "looking for monsters", asking an old, bedraggled man where the monsters are.
- Vall yells down an old (stairwell), "Bring me monsters!" 
- After some time, a deep voice responds, "What fool disturbs me here?"

#### What Lies Beneath

- An undead draconic creature rises up to meet Val. 
- Val casts *Dominate Monster* and succeeds.
- She commands the monster to slay the old man, take his form, and then ascend the steps.

#### Scene Unfolds

- Horns and his owls fly towards the tower.
- Rinn dashes as far north as he can and climbs a structure, calling for Val.
- An invisible Finn runs North and converses with Magrin.
- Gray activates his magic griffon and moves north along with [Master Elian Amaadon](/dnd/npcs/elian-amaadon/). Gray ignites a damage rite as he ascends.
- Val wildshapes into a seagull from within the castle and flies off, with everyone still unaware of her involvement.

#### A momentary Pause

- The monster in the old man form starts shambling north from the Tower.
- As Gray on Griffon-back approaches, Rinn yells out that he should check out the old man.
- Gray smells the undeath on the man and attacks and restrains him with his whip.
- Finn runs closer to Gray and company.

#### Go forth and burninate

- From the docks, Val summons forth some magma mephits to go forth and burninate. One is sent south with specific instructions to set the farm fields ablaze.
- Some guards in the area see Val and approach. Val eviscerates guards with her draconic great sword.

#### In Val's Mind

- Val views the enfolding seen in Neverwinter from within her mind, as if viewing her actions on a movie screen. She sits on a plush couch.
- She converses with Graz'zt, and asks for her control back.
- He laughs and directs spikes to come out from the couch she is bound to, and the many blades press deeper into her form.

#### Long Range Engagement

- Engaging from a great distance, Rinn drops a mephit and seriously wounds two more.
- However, one of the mephits successfully summons replacements.
- The southern-most mephit continues to burn the fields in the southwest.

#### Battle Continues

- The now-unmasked Draconian Dreadnought attacks Gray.
- An invisible Finn grapples the monster.
- Gray and his griffon take out the foe, which explodes in a necrotic blast, killing some nearby citizens.
