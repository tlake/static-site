summary: >
  The Prince of Frost redoubles the biting winter storm, and Ffywellyn communes with the Briarheart to fight back. Gray borrows life from his future, Gimble studies the winter fey from the safety of his tiny hut, and Finn only barely keep herself conscious through grit and force of will. Zed zips around on a flying broom and pulls Finn out of harm's way with a magic rope, and Horns dabbles once more with healing magic before the Prince of Frost is finally defeated.
