## Summary

Alone and defiant, [Finn](/dnd/characters/finn/) squares up against the incoming bone devil and its guard. She is swiftly restrained by a chain devil, and Finn summons her signature flumphs in retribution, but this does not stop the bone devil from savagely attacking Finn with its claws and hideous stinger. Meanwhile, [Gelfondi](/dnd/npcs/gelfondi/) falls beneath a mountain of minotaurs and a wicked blight spell from [Val](/dnd/characters/val/). The party comes to Finn's aid, empowering her with protective magic as they join the battle. In a rage, Finn breaks free of the chains and climbs _atop the bone devil_ to continue her attack. [Horns](/dnd/characters/horns/) summons a wolf pack and wild shapes into a giant elk to lead them in a charge. Seizing the moment, [Zed](/dnd/characters/zed/) mounts giant elk-Horns and smites the bone devil mightily while his minotaur berserkers join the chaotic melee. Against the Menagerie's signature flood of creatures, the devils have little chance and the western corridor is soon cleared.

## Synopsis

### Recap

> [2022-02-02 Import Campaign](/dnd/2022-02-02/)
>
> The party carefully creeps along the southern corridor towards the west, hoping to avoid further detection. At the sight of a bone devil ahead, [Zed](/dnd/characters/zed/) and his minotaurs instead choose to (somehow) squeeze into a small alcove towards the center of the tower, where they uncover two hidden imps keeping watch. After a long conversation, the imps are finally dispatched, but not before the dying shriek of one alerts the devils in the hallway. Most of the party swiftly runs into the next room, much to the surprise of [[Gelfondi]] himself, who is soon overwhelmed by minotaurs and a _Wand of Binding_. However, before [Val](/dnd/characters/val/) can enter the room and shut the door, the bone devil and more guards loom near. Sensing the approaching danger, [Finn](/dnd/characters/finn/) rushes out to face the powerful foe and its retinue on her own!

### Events

#### Battle with Gelfondi and Guards

- A chain devil ensnares and restrains [Finn](/dnd/characters/finn/), who summons more flumphs in retribution.
- [Zed](/dnd/characters/zed/)'s minotaur horde dispatches [Gelfondi](/dnd/npcs/gelfondi/).
- [Val](/dnd/characters/val/) casts _blight_ on the horned devil.
- [Gray](/dnd/characters/haeltin-var-astora/) casts a blood curse on one of the devils menacing Finn.
- [Rinn'thalas](/dnd/characters/rinnthalas-liadon/) runs up to cast _Protection from Evil and Good_ on Finn, and then he turns right back around to hide amongst the herd of minotaur.
- [Horns](/dnd/characters/horns/) summons a pack of wolves, surrounding the bone devil.
- The bone devil lays into Finn, and successfully hits her with its stinger.
- Barbed devil attacks the wolves.
- Finn breaks free of the chain devil's grapple and jumps on top of the Bone devil! She then throws her hand axe at the chain devil in spite, and then summons another flumph.
- The chain devil attempts to frighten Finn, but is repulsed by the _Protection from Good and Evil_ spell. The devil then tries to pull Finn down from the bone devil. She is restrained again.
- Zed casts _Warding Bond_ on Finn, and then moves in with his minotaur horde. The minotaurs are excited as clapping as they approach, and they start howling when they see the wolves.
- The barbed devil tosses some fireballs at Finn, who ducks and dives them.
- Val uses his bow to attack the bone devil at range, deftly finding a shot between the twisting mass of minotaurs.
- Gray climbs over the throng of minotaurs and jumps over the chain devil to approach the one fleeing barbed devil. He lays into the barbed devil and restrains him.
- Rinn'thalas climbs up the wall and jumps between the sconces to get a view on the battlefield. He sees the fleeing barbed devil restrained by Gray. Rinn dives off the wall to and fires off two arrows that thread the needle between the mass of minotaurs, wolves, and just past Gray's ear to drop the devil.
- Horns turns into a giant elk and shoves a barbed devil out of the way (ouch!) to lay into the Bone Devil.
- The bone devil attacks Finn and defends with lots of help from Zed's warding bond.
- The wolves all attack the bone devil.
- Barbed devil attacks Horns.
- Finn breaks free of the chained devil's restraints and sticks her tongue out at it.
- The chain devil tries to attack Finn again, but it misses.
- Zed flies down on his broom and mounts Giant Elk Horns and then attacks the bone devil and smites it strongly. Lancelot proclaims, "Swish!" The bone devil is still standing.
- The berserkers are go.
- Val walks out and shoots another arrow at the chain devil.
- Rinn walks out to survey the battlefield, thinks it is taken care of, and walks back into the Machine room to inspect Gelfondi's remains. He finds a key and two soul coins. He does not pocket the soul coins. Instead, he would motion to [Oneshoe](/dnd/characters/oneshoe/) to inspect them for her target.
- Giant Elk Horns savages the remaining devil. The battle has ended.
