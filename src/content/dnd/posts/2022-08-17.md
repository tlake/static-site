## Summary

[Val](/dnd/characters/val/) continues her internal fight with [Graz'zt](/dnd/npcs/grazzt/) for control. The party finds it difficult to track their friend as she repeatedly teleports around Neverwinter. Finally sighting Val at a distance, [Rinn'thalas](/dnd/characters/rinnthalas-liadon/) shows no hesitation in committing to a lethal assault. [The Vigil](/dnd/npcs/the-vigil/) sends word that an infamous operative has been tasked to remove the threat. Finally, thanks to information gathered by [Oneshoe](/dnd/characters/oneshoe/), [Master Elian](/dnd/npcs/elian-amaadon/) is able to teleport the party near Val's location. They race to subdue the wayward druid peacefully before either she destroys more lives or loses her own in the process.

## Synopsis

### Recap

> [Graz'zt](/dnd/npcs/grazzt/)/[Val](/dnd/characters/val/) continues her rampage through Neverwinter, ably avoiding view of the party, who is searching for Val from the skies atop gryphon and [Horns](/dnd/characters/horns/)' flock of giant owls. Fires rage at the ports and southwestern fields, but the city begins to mobilize a response. [Oneshoe](/dnd/characters/oneshoe/) attempts to acquire more reinforcements from her patron and the city leadership. [Finn](/dnd/characters/finn/) channels aggression into a one-halfling fire brigade. Within the prison of her mind, Val struggles to resist Graz'zt's control. [Rinn'thalas](/dnd/characters/rinnthalas-liadon/) spots a more fiendish form of Val as she cuts down a guard on a distant battlement, and he sends off a report to headquarters before pursuing his target. [Gray](/dnd/characters/haeltin-var-astora/) tracks Val to her last location, but his heightened senses determine that she has completely disappeared.

### Events

#### Val Temporarily Lucid

- [Val](/dnd/characters/val/) intentionally expends her highest current level spell slot (6th) to reduce her resources.
- She casts *Sunbeam* in the sky above her to ping her position.
- Val mutters, "Fuck you, bitch!"
- Val sees in a window a figure. She reads his lips, and it says, "Reporting from Alabaster North. I think we have found the target."

#### Message to OneShoe

- [Oneshoe](/dnd/characters/oneshoe/) gets a call from [Deputy Mayor Crandall](/dnd/npcs/deputy-mayor-crandall/), who lets her know that Val has been sighted at "Alabaster North"
- Oneshoe conveys this to [Master Elian](/dnd/npcs/elian-amaadon/).

#### Message from the Vigil

- [Gregor](/dnd/npcs/gregor/) calls [Rinn'thalas](/dnd/characters/rinnthalas-liadon/) back. 
- They are sending [Unidius](/dnd/npcs/unidius/), which is not necessarily a good thing. Unidius has a reputation for being very effective, but using questionable methods to do so.

#### Party Converging for Teleport

- Master Elian shouts that the party should converge to teleport to Val's last known position.
- Oneshoe drops [Chad](/dnd/npcs/chad/) down to the ground, and he skates away on a longboard.

#### Val Fighting with Graz'zt

- Val gets control again.
- She teleports back to the tower. She now looks mostly like the avatar of [Graz'zt](/dnd/npcs/grazzt/).
- The guard she previously charmed shits himself at her arrival.

#### Val Cannot be Restrained

- [Horns](/dnd/characters/horns/) sweeps down and tries to grapple Val, but she easily shakes him off.

#### Target in Sight

- With Val now in sight, Rinn goes invisible and strikes, sinking two arrows into Val.

#### At the Temple of Sune

- Graz'zt is back in control. He teleports himself to the doorstep of the Temple of Sune.
- [Trynna Breargarden](/dnd/npcs/trynna-breargarden/) starts to welcome the figure, but then steps back in fear.

#### On the Horn

- Oneshoe tries to call Crandall, but he doesn't have new info yet.

#### Graz'zt is Back

- Val submits to the Graz'zt. Hoping to buy Trynna's life.
- Graz'zts casts *Conjure Animals* to summon eight diseased rats to spread a plague around the city.

#### Naked Mad-Eye Moody?

- Rinn'thalas gets another message from HQ: "Just so you know, he's here." Rinn swears under his breath.
- Near Val, an old naked man with a towel wrapped around his neck comes out of the bath. Unidius is on the scene.
- He has an eye patch and an artificial leg. The man glowers at Val/Graz'zt and starts to cast a lightning bolt through the crowd. He screams, "Get back to the Abyss, you bitch."
- Val/Graz'zt tries to negate the spell, but fails.

#### Party Closes in on Val

- Oneshoe gets some intel of Val's location
- Master Elian teleports the party (sans Rinn) close by.

#### Val Faces off against Unidius

- Graz'zt easily shreds a large portion of Unidius' defensive magic.

#### Val Gets Control Again

- She bolts from Unidius and ends up right in front of Oneshoe.
- Meanwhile more rats are spreading disease.
- Horns tries to use the *Wand of Fear* to command Val to stand down, but she easily shrugs off the compulsion. Val will not submit so easily.
- Unidius tries to send a powerful firebolt at Val, but she easily negates the spell.

#### Can They Hug it Out?

- Graz'zt returns to power and lays into Oneshoe with the draconic greatsword.
- [Finn](/dnd/characters/finn/) gives Val a great bear hug in an attempt to halt the melee.
- [Gray](/dnd/characters/haeltin-var-astora/) tells Val that he needs Val to keep fighting Graz'zt.
- Master Elian casts *Time Stop*. As the world around him is frozen, he closes distance, sets up a ritual, and activates some items in an attempt to bind Val.
- Oneshoe hits Val with radiant damage.

#### Coup de Gr√¢ce

- Val manages to resist Graz'zt one more time.
- During her brief moment of clarity, Gray gets Val's consent and hits her with the *Dagger of Feign Death* which incapacitates her fully and renders her in a temporary state indistinguishable from death.
- Unidius sees this and starts to cast *Blight* at Val's body to end things.
- Master Elian scornfully counterspells the spell from Unidius, and teleports the bulk of the party and the inert form of Val to the Mage school.
