## Summary

After spending some time with the stone giant [Keith Stone](/dnd/npcs/keith-stone/), the party continues gathering intel for their Caper at Fierna's Tower. They speak with [Melkor](/dnd/npcs/melkor/) and later [Aeortis](/dnd/npcs/aeortis/), who gives them detailed information about the tower's construction in exchange for a new contract to retrieve something extra from the tower. A letter is delivered to the party by a strange messenger.

> After much deliberation, the party reluctantly signs a modified form of [Tymphal's Contract](/dnd/notes/tymphals-contract/) in order to engage [Carmen](/dnd/npcs/carmen/)'s services. [Horns](/dnd/characters/horns/) also receives a surprise visit from an old companion which had been kept secret from the party until now.

#### A Secret Message

- Unknown to the party, [Rinn'thalas](/dnd/characters/rinnthalas-liadon/) has been searching for them on the request of Baron [Gorstag](/dnd/characters/gorstag/). He has been checking various portals to Phlegethos for signs of the party.
- He catches up to them outside Aeortis's house.
- Hears a dog whistle from inside; plays it back. Gray comes outside.
