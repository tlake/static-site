summary: >
  Val communes with the Briarheart, and in a bittersweet and selfless moment, gives Soliyandar to Ffywellyn. Horns casts _plant growth_ and learns that Winter is not so easily forfended. Finn finally leads the party to the fey crossing to rendezvous with Willoughby the Whether Gnome, and they patch together a plan of action: ride on the back of Willoughby to the Spring Court, stopping only briefly to gain a new _transport via plants_ location near the Summer Court on the way.
