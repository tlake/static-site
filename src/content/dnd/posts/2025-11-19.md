summary: >
  Gimble's magic draws the attention of one of the nautiloids, and one of its tentacles sprouts eyes that emit a psychic pulse. The nautiloids rain drop-pods down on the party, and they must contend with a host of intellect devourers, ceremorphs, and the mutated results of illithid experimentation on abducted creatures; an elder brain dragon even makes an appearance. Finn follows the advice of the lunar deity in her mind and peels a sliver off the moon like an apple. As the tides of battle shift in favor of the illithid invasion, a frigid tempest builds on the horizon and rushes towards the group at alarming speed. Moments later the ice storm arrives, lightning flashing and ice crashing all around them as the rider of storm makes herself known: it is Mab, the Queen of Air and Darkness, and she immediately engages with the elder brain dragon.
