The party is approached with an offer of work to pay off [Carmen](/dnd/npcs/carmen)'s hefty fee to defend [Horns](/dnd/characters/horns), but it requires making another deal with a devil.

## Synopsis

### Recap

### Events

### News from the Feywild

- At The Brimstone, [Zed](/dnd/characters/zed) is visited by an old acquaintance from the Summer Court, Cylin.
- He shares that the power of the Summer Court is waning, [Queen Titania](/dnd/npcs/queen-titania) is still out of commission, and [Oberon](/dnd/npcs/oberon) has been leading the Wild Hunt without any sign of stopping.

### Carmen's Cake Buffet

- [Carmen](/dnd/npcs/carmen) places a special order for a delivery of cake to her residence. She indulges in several "pieces" of cake, including [Zed](/dnd/characters/zed).

### Ignaroz and Tymphal's Contract

- Back at The Brimstone, the party is met by a white spined devil who introduces herself as [Ignaroz](/dnd/npcs/ignaroz).
