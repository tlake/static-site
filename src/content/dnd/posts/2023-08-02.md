Inside room 420, the Menagerie begin to settle into their suite as Gimble shuts himself in his room and casts _contact other plane_ in search of answers.
He's met with a plane of darkness and can sense a presence, so he pushes his will through to it.
A crimson eye bleeds out from the blackness and Gimble recognizes it as a symbol of Gruumsh.
The orc deity expresses amusement at the gnome's presence and invites him to ask his questions.
As Gimble does, he feels as if Gruumsh is wringing something out.

1. Where in Candlekeep can Gimble find a book explaining the shard of Mystra?
    - No such book exists.

2. Where is the nearest pursuer?
    - Not far from Nesmé.

3. Will the pursuers ever pursue Gimble instead of Nyx?
    - It's possible.

4. What is the shard of Mystra?
    - It's all that Gruumsh has allowed to remain.

5. Where is Nyx now?
    - Not far from Nesmé.

Gruumsh's laughter fills the void, slowly fading away as the spell concludes and Gimble's mind is shunted back to his body.
