## Summary

The party carefully creeps along the southern corridor towards the west, hoping to avoid further detection. At the sight of a bone devil ahead, [Zed](/dnd/characters/zed/) and his minotaurs instead choose to (somehow) squeeze into a small alcove towards the center of the tower, where they uncover two hidden imps keeping watch. After a long conversation, the imps are finally dispatched, but not before the dying shriek of one alerts the devils in the hallway. Most of the party swiftly runs into the next room, much to the surprise of [Gelfondi](/dnd/npcs/gelfondi/) himself, who is soon overwhelmed by minotaurs and a *Wand of Binding*. However, before [Val](/dnd/characters/val/) can enter the room and shut the door, the bone devil and more guards loom near. Sensing the approaching danger, [Finn](/dnd/characters/finn/) rushes out to face the powerful foe and its retinue on her own!

## Synopsis

### Recap

> [2022-01-19 Import Campaign](/dnd/2022-01-10/)
>
> The party desperately tries to dispatch the the two horned devils and subordinate in the main corridor before the devils can alert the guard barracks and the rest of the tower. After dealing an infernal wound to [Zed](/dnd/characters/zed/), one horned devil makes a break for the barracks, and it seems the party is unable to stop it in time. And then Zed sounds the *Horn of the Endless Maze*. Enter a small army of Berserker minotaurs and innuendo, which the devils are no match for. The party clears the corridor with the guard barracks none the wiser, for now.

### Events

### Eastern Corridor

- The party sorts out some healing (mostly from [Horns](/dnd/characters/horns/)).

## Southern Corridor

- They start to explore the southern corridor. Most of this had been emptied already.

### Western Corridor

- From a distance, some party members see a large bone devil further down the corridor.

### Small Alcove

- [Gray](/dnd/characters/haeltin-var-astora/) hears some voices speaking in hushed infernal, but he can't see anyone. He calls in [Rinn'thalas](/dnd/characters/rinnthalas-liadon/) to investigate, but the wood elf is not able to hear the muffled voices at all.
- [Zed](/dnd/characters/zed/) guides all of his minotaur bros to somehow squeeze into the alcove.
- [Val](/dnd/characters/val/) briefly thought about crowd-surfing atop the group of minotaurs, but changed her mind when she considered the point(s) of the matter.
- Zed hears the chatter between the imps, who are desperately trying to remain unnoticed.
- Zed pulls out his *Lantern of Revealing* to reveal to flying imps in the alcove.
- A long conversation ensues between the imps, Horns, and Zed. Horns seems to be rather trusting, and the imps just want to get away unscathed.
- One imp mention that the boss of the level is [Gelfondi](/dnd/npcs/gelfondi/).
- [Finn](/dnd/characters/finn/) asked the names of the imps. One is named Humphrey. The other, Cracks.
- Both Horns and Finn give their real names to the imps!
- Seeing the exchange, Rinn'thalas, Gray, and [Oneshoe](/dnd/characters/oneshoe/) prepare to quietly take out the imps. Meanwhile, Zed intends to open the door to the next room.
- Oneshoe quickly takes out Humphrey.
- Before the others can react, Zed jumps up and lances Cracks. The imp survives this first attack, and lets out a shriek of pain before Zed can finish it off.
- Zed's minotaurs pile into the next room.

### Machine Room

- Inside the room is a horned devil, slightly shorter than most of his kind and dressed in some type of robes. It appears to be [Gelfondi](/dnd/npcs/gelfondi/). He is standing next to a small machine in the center of the room. There is a soul-coin slot and a large blade switch on the wall.
- The minotaurs quickly surround and menace the devil. Zed tries to capitalize on this by attempting to intimidate Gelfondi, but the horned devil does not back down.
- Zed then directs the minotaurs to attack.
- Val uses her *Wand of Binding* on Gelfondi, who becomes paralyzed.
- Gray lays into to the helpless devil.
- Rinn'thalas pulls Finn into the room and joins in the attack, directing others to get in the room and close the door behind them.
- Horns pulls Oneshoe inside the room and strikes at Gelfondi. The door remains open, with just Val alone in the alcove.

### Battle in the Corridor

- Alerted by the earlier scream of the dying imp, the bone devil and others approach the alcove room from the corridor.
- Finn senses the danger menacing the party and suddenly rushes out to face the powerful foe alone!
