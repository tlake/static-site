## Summary

The party desperately tries to dispatch the the two horned devils and subordinate in the main corridor before the devils can alert the guard barracks and the rest of the tower. After dealing an infernal wound to [Zed](/dnd/characters/zed), one horned devil makes a break for the barracks, and it seems the party is unable to stop it in time. And then Zed sounds the *Horn of the Endless Maze*. Enter a small army of Berserker minotaurs and innuendo, which the devils are no match for. The party clears the corridor with the guard barracks none the wiser, for now.

## Synopsis

### Recap

> [2022-01-05 Import Campaign](/dnd/posts/2022-01-05)
>
> After the relative success last session stealthily clearing out the southeastern perimeter of the tower, the party initially follows a similar tactic: luring guards in small groups into the library to be dispatched quietly. Things go well at first. Then [Val](/dnd/characters/val) gets bored. She suddenly leaves the party to chat up a dragon, and when the group tries to follow, [Zed](/dnd/characters/zed) gets the attention of a guardian hellhound, which alerts some of the more powerful devils in the tower.

### Events

#### Eastern Corridor Battle

- Battle ensues in the corridor. The party tries to dispatch the devils before they can alert the guard barracks.
- [Oneshoe](/dnd/characters/oneshoe), gravely injured, remains hidden in a doorway, within striking distance of a horned devil. Luckily, she is able to retreat into another room unseen.
- [Gray](/dnd/characters/haeltin-var-astora) restrains the northern horned devil with his *Chains of the Black Inferno* and begins to deal heavy damage to his opponent with his lightning claws.
- The barbed devil runs towards the barracks to get help.
- [Zed](/dnd/characters/zed) uses his *Horn of the Endless Maze* to summon 10 berserkers from the Abyss, who apparently have the demeanor of excited "frat-bros."
- The *rakshasa* calls out from the study in infernal to keep it down outside.
- [Finn](/dnd/characters/finn) summons several *Flumphs* to explode on the enemies.
- [Rinn'thalas](/dnd/characters/rinnthalas-liadon) casts *Haste* on himself and streaks around the battlefield, rapid firing arrows, but many do not find their target amid the chaos from the wall of berserkers.
- [Zed](/dnd/characters/zed) takes an *infernal wound* from the horned devil.
- Some shenanigans with [Zed](/dnd/characters/zed)'s berserkers trying to perform a pyramid over [Oneshoe](/dnd/characters/oneshoe), who gets some interesting visuals.
- One of the berserkers successfully grapples the southern horned devil to prevent it from going into the guard barracks. The minotaur even takes several strikes from the horned devil and remains standing.
- The party finally takes out all the devils in the corridor before they can alert the guard barracks. However, [Zed](/dnd/characters/zed) looks like he is itching to continue the fight.
