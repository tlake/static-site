description: In which Gray prepares for another encounter with the dragon fanboys.
summary: >
  The party spends some time in some of Neverwinter's most popular locations, such as the burned and flooded marina district, the ever-popular Jefferson's place (I forgot the name again), the Mage's College, and a long-abandoned farmstead a couple miles north of the city.

## The Marina District

- OneShoe tries to find answers about the anomalous winter weather, and figures sailors know a lot about the weather, so she goes to the Marina District in western Neverwinter.
- The Marina District is largely ruined after having been flooded to put out the fires caused by Val's rampage; buildings are unstable, boats are beached.
- She enters a combination sailor's temple and dockhouse (I forget the name of this place as well) to chat up a salty old seadog, asks him if he knows where the snow's coming from.
- "The sky" is his answer; it turns out the source of a freak snowstorm is a mystery to this sailor.
- OneShoe's hits the streets like a good P.I. and learns that while there may be several theories circulating the city, nobody really has a definitive answer.

## Jefferson's Nightclub (Name Forgotten)

- The party recalls that Jefferson wanted them to stop back in if they survived their trip to Baator, so they do.
- Horns asks about Jefferson's wing-accomodating clothing, and learns that Jefferson has a tailor by the name of Bartleby. He gives Horns one of Bartleby's business cards.

## Mage's College

- Rinn has a conversation with Master Elian about the threat of Val. Master E explains that while Val's choice was perhaps rooted in ignorance or naivete, she's not actually evil and he believes that the planes are safe from another of her Graz'zt-impelled rampages. He further says that if she does turn to Graz'zt again, he would put her down himself.
- Rinn explains that his organization - the Vigil - has less faith in Val than Master E, and that they're currently committed to eliminating her threat in a lethal manner. He explains that this is the same organization that Unidius is (kinda) pledged to, and that if Master E were to commit himself to the Vigil and to the supervision of Val, they would be amenable to not hunting her down.
    - Additionally, it would be much appreciated to have an operative in the city who wasn't Unidius.
- Master E agrees after explaining that he cannot commit the resources of the Mage's College to the Vigil, and Rinn inducts him by giving him part of the modified _sending stone_ that Rinn uses to communicate with his order.
    - We learn here that Elian's last name is Amaadon, which means silverflower.

## Abandoned Farmstead, ~2 miles north of Neverwinter
