summary: >

_~ 30 Eleasis 1492 DR_

## The Marina District

- OneShoe tries to find answers about the anomalous winter weather, and figures sailors know a lot about the weather, so she goes to the Marina District in western Neverwinter.
- The Marina District is largely ruined after having been flooded to put out the fires caused by Val's rampage; buildings are unstable, boats are beached.
- She enters a combination sailor's temple and dockhouse to chat up a salty old seadog, asks him if he knows where the snow's coming from.
- "The sky" is his answer; it turns out the source of a freak snowstorm is a mystery to this sailor.
- OneShoe's hits the streets like a good P.I. and learns that while there may be several theories circulating the city, nobody really has a definitive answer.
- She does however catch some of the falling snow in a vial and cobbles together a rudimentary alchemist kit from her poisoner's kit, and after some experimentation she discovers that it is, in fact, mundane snow.

## Jefferson's Nightclub (Name Forgotten)

- The party recalls that [Jefferson](/dnd/npcs/jefferson) wanted them to stop back in if they survived their trip to Baator, so they do.
- Horns asks about Jefferson's wing-accommodating clothing, and learns that Jefferson has a tailor by the name of Bartleby. He gives Horns one of Bartleby's business cards.

## Mage's College

- Rinn has a conversation with [Master Elian](/dnd/npcs/elian-amaadon) about the threat of Val. Master E explains that while Val's choice was perhaps rooted in ignorance or naivete, she's not actually evil and he believes that the planes are safe from another of her [Graz'zt](/dnd/npcs/grazzt)-impelled rampages. He further says that if she does turn to Graz'zt again, he would put her down himself.
- Rinn explains that his organization - the Vigil - has less faith in Val than Master E, and that they're currently committed to eliminating her threat in a lethal manner. He explains that this is the same organization that Unidius is (kinda) pledged to, and that if Master E were to commit himself to the Vigil and to the supervision of Val, they would be amenable to not hunting her down.
    - Additionally, it would be much appreciated to have an operative in the city who wasn't [Unidius](/dnd/npcs/unidius).
- Master E agrees after explaining that he cannot commit the resources of the [Mage's College](/dnd/locations/mage-college) to the Vigil, and Rinn inducts him by giving him part of the modified _sending stone_ that Rinn uses to communicate with his order.
    - We learn here that Elian's last name is Amaadon, which means silverflower.

## Abandoned Farmstead, ~2 miles north of Neverwinter

- Gray notifies the party that he has some mission to take care of outside of the city, and asks them to come with.
- They come upon an abandoned farmstead as described in the brief, and OneShoe and Rinn'thalas crouch down in the tall grass and go on a forward scouting mission.
- They investigate the ruined farmhouse and find it empty, then move on to the ruined grain silo.
- Rinn stealthily climbs up the exterior of the silo, and at the top he manages to notice a figure holed up at a viewport in full camoflage.
- Still silent, he makes his way back down and together with OneShoe they return to the rest of the party by the roadside to inform them of the situation.
- Rinn and OneShoe sneak off to find hidden positions to the north, and Gray tells Horns and Zed to stay back and be prepared in case the cultists try to escape.
- Gray alters his appearance to be that of the late Gray and makes his way towards the silo, trying to draw the creature out, but stops short when he feels an intrusion in his mind. He's able to push it back, then calls the creature down.
- A hulking orcish woman leaps from her recon spot at the top of the silo and superhero-lands in front of him.
- She addresses him as Gray and asks a few pointed questions about his prolonged absence, and Gray recognizes her assomeone named Mountain.
- After a short conversation, they agree to head back to Neverwinter to catch up over drinks, and the two make their back to the roadside where Zed and Horns are doing their best to stay hidden.
- As Gray and Mountain begin to make their way south back into the city, Zed and Bullwinkle burst forth from their "hiding spot" behind a tree to assault Mountain, making sure that she doesn't "escape."
