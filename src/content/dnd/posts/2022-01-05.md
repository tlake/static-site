summary: >
  After the relative success last session stealthily clearing out the southeastern perimeter of the tower, the party initially follows a similar tactic: luring guards in small groups into the library to be dispatched quietly. Things go well at first. Then Val suddenly leaves the party to chat up a dragon, and when the group tries to follow, Zed gets the attention of a guardian hellhound, which alerts some of the more powerful devils in the tower.

## Scaena et Tempore

_Probably sometime around `DR 1492-08 (Eleasis, Highsun)`_

_[The Nine Hells](the-nine-hells-of-baator.md) | [Phlegethos](/dnd/locations/phlegethos) | [Fierna's Tower](/dnd/locations/fiernas-tower)_

## Synopsis

### Recap

> [2021-12-22 Import Campaign](/dnd/posts/2021-12-22)
>
> [Oneshoe](/dnd/characters/oneshoe) took point leading the party as they explored the first set of rooms along the perimeter of the tower going from Southwest corner counterclockwise towards the East. They find some torture victims and survive the activation of a devious torture chamber themselves. One of the party's targets has been found. No sign of [Magrin](/dnd/npcs/magrin) yet.

### Events

#### Library

- [Horns](/dnd/characters/horns), in his bee form, buzzes out into the hallway to scout. Apparently, he buzzes very loudly and gets the attention of a nearby chain devil. Horns flies back into the room.
- The chain devil slowly comes in the room as the party lies in stealthily in wait.
- The chain devil spots [Zed](/dnd/characters/zed), and the party jumps the chain devil, quickly dispatching it.
- [Oneshoe](/dnd/characters/oneshoe) creeps out the door to investigate the next room to the north.
- She notices that more devils in the hallway may have noticed the chain devil's absence, but she says nothing and continues on.

#### Study

- In the next room, [Oneshoe](/dnd/characters/oneshoe) sees a desk and chair with a few imps and a "tiger-man".

#### Room of Desire

- A stone table, with a female figure upon it. She is emaciated. There is a great big black helmet on her head. A black cord stretches from her helmet to the ceiling. She is writhing and groaning in apparent pleasure and oblivious to her surroundings.

#### Back in the Library

- The two bearded devils come in to investigate.
- The party lies unseen in wait. Val closes the door behind the devils as they enter the room and starts to tear out the throat of the first devil.
- A battle ensues. [Zed](/dnd/characters/zed), missing Bullwinkle, uses grand gestures to mime riding a horse as he rushes in to attack.

#### Cold Prison

- Cut back to [Oneshoe](/dnd/characters/oneshoe), who is scouting way ahead on her own.
- The room is terribly cold, and it contains a white dragon bound on a chain.
- Also a *tanarukk*, shivering in the corner.

#### Back in the Library Again

- The party cuts down the remaining two devils. [Val](/dnd/characters/val) squeegees the gooey remains into a corner with a book.
- Most of the party decides to peruse the library further as they wait for [Oneshoe](/dnd/characters/oneshoe)'s return.
- [Rinn](/dnd/characters/rinnthalas-liadon) goes to look for [Oneshoe](/dnd/characters/oneshoe).

#### Northeast Corridor

- [Oneshoe](/dnd/characters/oneshoe) peeks in the guard barracks, then retraces her steps back to the party in the library.

#### Library Planning

- [Oneshoe](/dnd/characters/oneshoe) relates what she found to the party.
- She and [Rinn](/dnd/characters/rinnthalas-liadon) plan scouting a few more areas together.
- Meanwhile, [Val](/dnd/characters/val) calls "Master E" through the sending stones to ask about her Draconic language training.

#### Steamy Harp Room

- Imps playing harps in a sauna room.
- They explore the corridor north to find another horned devil at the northernmost point.
- They return to the party and explain the options.

#### Library Parting

- Back in the library, the party goes over possible plans. [Val](/dnd/characters/val) brings up the idea of unleashing the dragon. [Rinn](/dnd/characters/rinnthalas-liadon) recommends the southern route.
- [Val](/dnd/characters/val), seemingly bored, suddenly rushes out of the room, saying "meet me at the dragon!"

#### Eastern Corridor

- Surprised, the party follows Val out the door.
- [Zed](/dnd/characters/zed) drops a book along the way and alerts the nearby hellhound, which starts barking loudly in the corridor.
- Roll initiative.

#### Room of Desire / Cold Prison

- Meanwhile, [Val](/dnd/characters/val) leaves the party mid-combat and enters the room of desire. She opens the door to talk with the dragon. She asks in halting draconic, "Are you a prisoner or with the devils?"
- Val asks for assistance from the dragon, but it is dubious of her attempts. Val almost blurts out that she was looking for a dwarf.
- Eventually, the white dragon, named [Zarinor](/dnd/npcs/zarinor), tells Val of another dragon on the material plane named Harion, who slew the white dragon and took its horde.
- Zarinor offers the location of Harion, and asks Val to slay him. In return, she can keep the treasure. He mentions a location in the northern regions of the sword coast.
- Val asks for a scale from the dragon, who gives it to her.

#### Eastern Corridor Battle

- The party takes out the hellhound and weakens his enraged barbed devil handler, who hurls two balls of flame at [Oneshoe](/dnd/characters/oneshoe) in revenge.
- The two horned devils, having heard the hound's barking, approach from the north and south, respectively, and are now in easy reach of both the party and the doors leading to the guard barracks.
- The session ends with the party in a difficult spot.
