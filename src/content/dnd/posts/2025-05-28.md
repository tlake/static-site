summary: >
  The Menagerie windwalk in search of the ancient white dragon that once had been a snow-covered hill. They're successful in tracking it down, and talk it into landing. The party is split between trying to fight the dragon and trying to lie to the dragon, and eventually Gray is able to use the Heart of Winter to convince the dragon that they're here at the behest of the Queen of Air and Darkness. They manage to convince the dragon to hand over the frozen form of Kellis and barely avoid being conscripted into whatever the dragon's current purpose is, and it flies away to resume its quest. As the Menagerie begin the long trek back to the copse of trees, the dragon turns around and flies directly towards the party as a trio of nautiloid ships appear out of nowhere, as if dropping out of warp.

  The Menagerie investigate the strange crater where a hill should be, and between the giant gashes in the frozen earth and the scent in the air that Gray analyzes they conclude that the hill was never a hill at all, and was instead a dormant dragon that has since vacated the area. The party becomes clouds and windwalks, guided by Gray's nose, and an hour or two later they spot it: an ancient white dragon, questing to and fro in the skies.
