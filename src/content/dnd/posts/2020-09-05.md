_**Warning:** this post may contain spoilers for the "Baldur's Gate: Descent Into Avernus" 5e module._

At the entrance to the Wandering Emporium, the party was greeted again by the gracious Mahadi. OneShoe took The Menagerie's warmachines to the Firesnake Forge for touch-ups and repairs, and Gimble went to the outskirts of the Wandering Emporium to set up a _tiny hut_ and work on some magical studies.

Shortly thereafter, the group (sans Gimble) reconvened in front of the new arrival to the Wandering Emporium: a wooden wagon with "GRUNDLE & CHODE'S ARCANE BOUTIQUE" stenciled in gilded letters on its sides. As they approached, the side of the wagon folded outward to form a countertop and a plane of green canvas unrolled from above the opening to create an awning. Standing behind the counter were two enterprising goblins. The one who talks did so with gusto and at length, introducing himself as Grundle and his silent compatriot as Chode.

Grundle explained to The Menagerie that the Arcane Boutique travels far and wide, often going between planes. On the material plane, the closest they get to the party's headquarters in Phandalin is their yearly autumn stop in Waterdeep. As part of the contract they have with Asmodeus which allows them free passage throughout Avernus, any business they conduct in the Nine Hells must be done using _soul coins,_ and the goblins' strict "no haggling" code meant that all their items were available for one _soul coin_ each. OneShoe was less than pleased at the goblins' unwillingness to haggle, and walked off to oversee the work being done on the warmachines. The rest of the party, though, set about perusing the shop's goods.

> The details of the Arcane Boutique's inventory and the party's purchases are detailed at the end of this post.

In addition to selling their inventory, Grundle and Chode were on the lookout for other items of interest that the party might have. They were willing to purchase three items of _rare_ quality or better for two _soul coins._ Thus, after selling some of their excess inventory, The Menagerie concluded their shopping spree with 5 _soul coins_ remaining amongst them.

At one point during the shopping spree, Not-Bailey grew worried that Gimble was missing out on the potential for getting good loot, so she went to track him down, and Finn followed her. They found Gimble's _tiny hut,_ but the dome was completely opaque, didn't allow either of them passage, and Gimble wasn't responding to any of Finn's communications. After a few tense minutes, Gimble emerged from the _tiny hut_ and dismissed the spell, then apologized to Finn and Not-Bailey and told them that he had been lost in focus.

The shopping spree wound down, and Gimble struck up a brief conversation with Cassandra. She told him that one of The Reclamation's more prominent loci operandi (on the Material Plane, at least) is the Great Library at Candlekeep, a fair distance south of Waterdeep. Moreover, she explained that their primary headquarters is located somewhere on Mechanus, as well as one of their largest repository of dangerous artifacts. She intimated that if Gimble were ever in the market for a new vocation, he should inquire about The Reclamation at Candlekeep.

Gimble asked Grey if he still had the scroll of _plane shift._ Grey said he did, but he was increasingly reluctant to show it to Gimble just as Gimble was increasingly adamant that he do so.

Then, tensions began to rise.

The growing frustration that Gimble had been carrying around with him came out, and he could no longer hold his tongue about the things that he held important. His family - Nyx and Lyra - had finally been found, and yet here he was, in Hell, trying to dig the party out of yet another hole instead of staying with his family and helping to keep them safe while some unknown organization was hunting them down.

Gimble wished the party well and then, with an incantation and a gesture, disappeared.

Thinking quickly, Zed brought forth his _lantern of revealing_ and cast its light upon the general area around where Gimble had been. The edge of this light caught the tail of an invisible _imp_ sneaking off away from the group, and Zed gave chase. He called out to the _imp_ and entreated Gimble to stay. The _imp_ said that it didn't know what Zed was talking about, and kept edging away from the conversation and trying to leave. Zed cast _command_ on the _imp_ and compelled him to become Gimble. The spell took hold and the _imp_ looked confused for a moment, then transformed into a rat, which sat back on its haunches and shrugged at Zed. The _imp_ had no idea what a Gimble was, and just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time when Zed used his _lantern._

Gimble was gone.

The Menagerie stood uncertain in the dusty winds of Avernus, Cassandra awkwardly nearby. Feeling the need for a drink in the wake of Gimble's departure, Finn, Horns, Zed, and Cassandra made a visit to the Infernal Rapture for more 50-gp-each drinks and the accompanying 24-hour HP recovery buff.

## Grundle & Chode's Arcane Boutique

_Entries tagged with_ :moneybag: _denote items that the party has purchased._

Grundle recognized that Horns and Val were druids, and to incentivize the group to buy something, he offered this free magic item if the group made one or more purchases:

:moneybag: **[Fionnlagh's Phonic Retainer](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/2135138-fionnlaghs-phonic-retainer)**

> _Wondrous Item, rare_
>
> _Designed by the eccentric gnomish druid and tinkerer Fionnlagh Finni who had a great fondness for miniature clockwork constructions. He preferred to work while wild shaped into small monkeys (like talapoins or mangabeys), but while these forms were well-suited to tiny craftwork, their inability to communicate with assistants, etc. was a constant source of frustration._
>
> _If you wild shape while wearing this retainer, your original mouth is preserved throughout the transformation. This grants you the ability to speak almost the same as you normally could when not wild-shaped, at the expense of being able to verbally communicate as your wild shape form otherwise could._
>
> _You look weird, though. Do an image search for "animals with human teeth" to get a feel for how you look._

Apart from that, the following details the items available in and purchased from Grundle & Chode's Arcane Boutique:

### (Animalia)

:moneybag: **[Bridle of Ferocity](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/2130622-bridle-of-ferocity):**

> _Wondrous Item, rare (requires attunement by a by a mount similar enough to a horse to be able to wear a bridle)_
>
> _This finely-crafted bridle is made of supple, blue dragon's hide that shimmers with an opalescent sheen. It has 3 charges, and regains 1d4 spent charges every day at dawn._
>
> _While attuned to this bridle, its wearer may expend a charge as an action to cast dragon's breath upon itself._

:moneybag: **[The Goodest Neckerchief](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/2147788-the-goodest-neckerchief):**

> _Wondrous Item, rare (requires attunement by a by the goodest doggo (note: all doggos are the goodest doggo, and even some non-doggos can count as doggos))_
>
> _While attuned to this magical kerchief you can use your action to cast false life upon yourself at 3rd level, requiring no material components. Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you've completed a long rest._

:moneybag: **[Barding of Protection](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/2145529-barding-of-protection):**

> _Wondrous Item, rare_
>
> _Requires attunement by a mount. Barding which can be worn by a mount. You gain a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws while you wear this barding. You also confer a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws to your rider._

### (Armor)

**[Breastplate of Elemental Absorption, +1](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/2131386-breastplate-of-elemental-absorption-1)**

> _Armor (breastplate), rare (requires attunement)_
>
> _You have a +1 bonus to AC while wearing this armor. It has 6 charges, and regains 2d4 expended charges daily at dawn._
>
> _While attuned to this armor, whenever you are the target of - or subjected to a saving throw of - a spell or magical effect that would deal cold, fire, or lightning damage to you, you may use your reaction to cause the armor to absorb the spell on your behalf. If you do so, the spell has no effect on you, and the armor expends a number of charges equal to the spell's level. If the armor has fewer unspent charges than the level of the spell, it expends all remaining charges; then, roll 1d6+X where X is the difference between the absorbed spell's level and the number of charges that the armor spent. If the result is 5 or greater, the gem in the armor explodes, dealing 36 (12d6) force damage to you and all creatures within 10 feet of you. Each of these creatures other than you may make a DC 13 Dexterity save, taking half of that damage on a success. This explosion destroys both the armor and its enchantment._
>
> _Notes:_
>
> _- When absorbing a cantrip, the number of charges depends on the cantrip's scaling. As an example, consider firebolt: at its base level it deals 1d10 fire damage, which would require only one charge to absorb. Then, when the cantrip scales to 2d10 at level 5, it would require two charges to absorb; and so on._
>
> _- If you use the armor's ability to absorb an area of effect spell like fireball, it does not consume the entire spell. It absorbs the portion of the spell that would affect you directly, but any other creatures caught in the spell's area of effect would be unaffected by this armor's absorption and would interact with the spell as they otherwise would._

:moneybag: **[Bracers of Versatile Smackdown, +1](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/2133152-bracers-of-versatile-smackdown-1)**

> _Wondrous Item, very rare (requires attunement by a by a character with the ability to Smite (Divine Smite, Eldritch Smite, etc.))_
>
> _These magical bracers have 5 charges, and regain 1d4+1 unspent charges upon finishing a long rest._
>
> _While attuned to these bracers, you receive +1 to your armor class. Additionally, whenever you use a smite feature (such as divine smite or eldritch smite), you may expend one or more charges from these bracers as a free action to enact the following effects:_
>
> _Bigger Smite (1 charge): Add 1d8 to the smite's damage. This damage is the same type as the smite._
>
> _Different Smite (1 charge): Change all of the smite's damage to one of the following types: cold, fire, lightning, force, or radiant._

**[Armor of Attenuation, +1](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/2131395-armor-of-attenuation-1)**

> _Armor (half plate), very rare (requires attunement)_
>
> _You have a +1 bonus to AC while wearing this armor. It has 3 charges, and regains all expended charges daily at dawn._
>
> _While attuned to this armor, when you are subjected to an effect that would deal acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic, or radiant damage to you, you may use your reaction and expend one charge from the armor. If you do, you instead take only one third of that damage (rounded up). At the end of each of your next two turns, you take that same reduced amount of damage again._

:moneybag: **[Studded Leather of Borrowed Time, +1](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/2130739-studded-leather-of-borrowed-time-1)**

> _Armor (studded leather), rare (requires attunement)_
>
> _This masterfully-crafted suit of light- and slate-grey studded leather armor includes a leather cuirass, a gorget, pauldrons, and tassets, and confers an additional +1 bonus to your AC._
>
> _Borrowed time: While attuned to this armor, you can use a bonus action to speak the armor's command word and invoke its latent necrotic energy to borrow vigor from your own future. When you do so, the armor darkens to blacks and dark greys and you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to half of your maximum hit points (rounded down). These temporary hit points last for up to 24 hours or until you complete a long rest, whichever comes first. Once you've used this feature, you cannot use it again nor unattune to the armor until you've provided remuneration._
>
> _Remuneration: The next time you take a long rest after using borrowed time, the armor collects on your debt. After you've completed the long rest, you take damage equal to half of your maximum hit points (rounded down), and the armor reverts to its lighter color scheme. This damage cannot be avoided or reduced in any way._

**[Butcher's Bib](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/butchers-bib)**

> _Wondrous Item, rare (requires attunement)_
>
> _This black leather apron is perpetually covered by blood, even after being washed off. You gain the following benefits while wearing the apron:_
>
> _- Once per turn when you roll damage for a melee attack with a weapon, you can reroll the weapon’s damage dice. If you do so, you must use the second total._
