## Scaena et Tempore

_`DR 1492-08-30 (Eleasis, Highsun)`_

## Summary

With [Val](/dnd/characters/val) finally subdued, [Master Elian Amaadon](/dnd/npcs/elian-amaadon) teleports most of the party to the Mage College to begin the difficult work of attempting to remove Graz'zt's control over the wayward druid. Meanwhile, [Rinn'thalas](/dnd/characters/rinnthalas-liadon) notices an unseasonal snowfall as he confronts [Unidius](/dnd/npcs/unidius). Days pass, [Finn](/dnd/characters/finn) explores the local temples seeking guidance; [Gray](/dnd/characters/haeltin-var-astora) covertly handles a few things on his own in Neverwinter; [Horns](/dnd/characters/horns) assists the local druids in repairing the damage from the attack; and Rinn'thalas stands guard over an unconscious Val. When the druid finally awakens, she claims to be free of Graz'zt but has foul tidings for the party.

## Synopsis

### Recap

[Val](/dnd/characters/val) continues her internal fight with [Graz'zt](/dnd/npcs/grazzt) for control. The party finds it difficult to track their friend as she repeatedly teleports around Neverwinter. Finally sighting Val at a distance, [Rinn'thalas](/dnd/characters/rinnthalas-liadon) shows no hesitation in committing to a lethal assault. [The Vigil](/dnd/npcs/the-vigil) sends word that an infamous operative has been tasked to remove the threat. Finally, thanks to information gathered by [Oneshoe](/dnd/characters/oneshoe), [Master Elian](/dnd/npcs/elian-amaadon) is able to teleport the party near Val's location. They race to subdue the wayward druid peacefully before either she destroys more lives or loses her own in the process.

### Events

#### Val Loses Consciousness

- As [Val](/dnd/characters/val) loses consciousness after [Gray](/dnd/characters/haeltin-var-astora) struck her with the *Dagger of Feign Death*, she comes face to face with Graz'zt in her mind.
- She immediately tries to punch the demon prince, but he dodges easily, taunting her continuously.
- Graz'zt toys with Val and claims that she will lose his gifts if [Master Elian Amaadon](/dnd/npcs/elian-amaadon) succeeds in helping Val.
- Graz'zt's tries to influence Val by implied threats against her family, but she doesn't buy it.
- Val tries to conjure a box within her mind to imprison Graz'zt, but he cannot be so easily contained.
- Graz'zt keeps insinuating that her abyssal predilection "runs in her blood".

#### Master Elian Takes Val the Mage University

- He says that they will try to cure Val, but that the party isn't needed. He states that the party can find a place to stay in the city or they can stay in the student bunks.
- [Gray](/dnd/characters/haeltin-var-astora) asks [Master Elian Amaadon](/dnd/npcs/elian-amaadon) about the information about the steel panther that attacked them earlier.

#### Late Summer Snow in Neverwinter

- Astride a summoned owl, Rinn'thalas flies towards the last location of the party in the north of the city. As he approaches he notices something odd. A few flakes start drifting down from above, soon followed by many across the area. It has just started to snow in the Neverwinter - exceptionally unusual for the late summer.

#### The Party in the Mage College

- They see a fair number of warrior mages guarding the early rooms.
- Master Elian carries Val up to an office.

- Master Elian leads the party out to the gates where they tried to break in earlier.
- He states that he will let them know when they have progress updates on Val.
- [Horns](/dnd/characters/horns) takes note of the layout of some of the college and the activities of some of the students.
    - He looks around a bit, but doesn't see Piety anywhere.

#### Rinn Closes in on Unidius

- [Rinn'thalas](/dnd/characters/rinnthalas-liadon) closed in with [Unidius](/dnd/npcs/unidius) and asks about what happened with Val.
- Unidius was a crotchety old wizard and told his version of events.
- He seemed to be done with the interaction and stated he was returning to the bath to have his "3 o'clock whiskey".

#### Rinn and Gray

#### Rinn Checking on Val

- Master Elian takes Rinn to the medical ward.
- He speaks with Master Elian and asks about Val's condition
- Rinn stays and keeps watch over Val.

#### Finn Looking for Guidance

- Finn, feeling lost and scared and depressed, gets a few beers and wanders around Neverwinter looking for religious guidance.
- She stops in a temple to Lathander. She thinks it's a little fun, but it was a bit too bright and cheery for her current feeling.
- She stops at a few other temples and doesn't find a good match.
- Finn then stops in a small shrine to Selûne.
- She leaves a coin at the shrine.
- Finn hears a voice that asks if Finn is lost and what she needs.
- They have a long conversation and connect; the goddess helps to explain that there are many things Finn can't control - but she _can_ control herself and who she wants to be.
- The goddess asks if Finn would like her to walk beside her for a while, and Finn agrees.
    - The bond is sealed with a small amount of Finn's blood smeared onto the back of the shrine.

#### Gray's Walkabout

- Gray wanders to [Lily Ashewood](/dnd/npcs/lily-ashewood)'s estate, but leaves instead of approaching.
- Gray inspects the graveyard at Neverdeath.
    - As he walks along, Gray notices one particular crow overly-focused on him.
    - Gray stops, notices, and then walks away.
- Gray goes to the Temple of Sune to check on [Trynna Briegarden](/dnd/npcs/trynna-briegarden). He assesses the state of things, and he leaves.
- Gray then shifts his appearance to human more towards Gray and goes to the bar to see if he has any messages.
    - Gray sees a small scroll addressed to him. He pockets it and leaves.
    - _"Suspected cult of the dragon activity, abandoned farmhouse, ~2 miles north of Neverwinter"_
- He returns to the mage college.

#### Horns Assists the Druids to Quash the Remaining Wildfires

- Horns has the summoned owls help air drop water to quash the fires.
- He keeps noticing brief flashes of the icy visage of [Levistus](/dnd/npcs/levistus) in reflective surfaces.

#### Reunion at the Mage College

- Finn and Gray return to Val's room to oversee her recovery.
- Horns spends a fair bit of his time helping the druids oversee repairing some of the damage to Neverwinter from the attack.

#### Three Days Later

_`DR 1492-09-03 (Elient, The Fading)`_

- Val bucks violently awake. She snaps off one of her tethers, and she coughs up a black wad of goo.
- Master Elian arrives to check Val's status.
- Graz'zt's departing words have clicked an idea in Val's head about a connection between the abyss, [the missive that she pieced together](/dnd/notes/abyssal-note) from scattered, fractured sheafs, and her family's history.
- Master Elian found a "maker's mark" on the steel panther construct.
    - It refers to an entity or entities called "Cause and Effect", seemingly originating from somewhere in the interplanar hub city of Sigil, the City of Doors.
- The snow continues to fall, and the party wonders about the reason for it: spores from the abyssal influence mentioned in Val's note? Ripple effects from the events in the Feywild? A consequence of the restored connection between Horns and Levistus?

#### Gray Receives a Paper Crane

- A secret message.
