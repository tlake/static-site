## Summary

Val's rampage is over, she's whisked away to the medical ward in the mage's college, and Rinn is the first to notice that it's beginning to snow... in Neverwinter... in late summer.

Val spends three days in a coma with only [Graz'zt](/dnd/npcs/grazzt/) for company where he wheedles and heckles, and during those three days:

- Rinn has a brief conversation with [Unidius](/dnd/npcs/unidius/), then posts up in Val's room to keep watch.
- Horns takes part in some of the cleanup of the city, and keeps noticing brief flashes of the visage of Levistus in reflective surfaces.
- Gray wanders to [Lily Ashewood](/dnd/npcs/lily-ashewood/)'s estate, but leaves instead of approaching.
- Gray wanders to the Neverdeath graveyard, and leaves when he sees a raven watching him.
- Gray wanders to that tavern where he picks up messages for Gray, does a walk-by first, then picks up a message.
  - "Suspected cult of the dragon activity, abandoned farmhouse, ~2 miles north of Neverwinter"
- Gray receives a paper crane message.
- Finn, feeling lost and scared and depressed, wanders between various shrines and temples and churches and sundry religious institutions. She eventually comes to rest at a small, unoccupied shrine to Sel√ªne, and an ethereal voice makes a connection with her. They talk through some of the things weighing Finn down, and the goddess helps to explain that there are many things Finn can't control - but she _can_ control herself and who she wants to be. The goddess asks if Finn would like her to walk beside her for a while, and Finn agrees. The bond is sealed with a small amount of Finn's blood smeared onto the back of the shrine.

After multiple castings of _greater restoration_, the medical mages are finally successful in purging Graz'zt's influence from Val and she projectile vomits a chunk of sticky black ichor. Graz'zt's parting words to Val are to ask her if her predilection for the abyss is based on her own interests or just because it's in her blood.

Master Elian delivers the results of the college's investigation of the mechanical panther: the maker's mark on the construct's chest seems to indicate some entity (or entities) known as "Cause and Effect", seemingly originating from somewhere in the interplanar hub city of Sigil, the City of Doors.

Graz'zt's departing words have clicked an idea in Val's head about a connection between the abyss, [the missive that she pieced together](/dnd/hidden/abyssal-note) from scattered, fractured sheafs, and her family's history. The snow continues to fall, and the party wonders about the reason for it: spores from the abyssal influence mentioned in Val's note? Ripple effects from the events in the Feywild? A consequence of the restored connection between Horns and Levistus?
