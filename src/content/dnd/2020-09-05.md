At the entrance to the Wandering Emporium, the party was greeted agian by the gracious Mahadi. Finn, Horns, Zed, and Cassandra made a visit to the Infernal Rapture for more 50-gp-each drinks and the accompanying 24-hour HP recovery buff.

Meanwhile, OneShoe took The Menagerie's warmachines to the Firesnake Forge for touch-ups and repairs.

Shortly thereafter, the group reconvened in front of the new arrival to the Wandering Emporium: a wooden wagon with "GRUNDLE & CHODE'S ARCANE BOUTIQUE" stenciled in gilded letters on its sides. As they approached, the side of the wagon folded outward to form a countertop and a plane of green canvas unrolled outward from above the opening to create an awning. Standing behind the counter were two enterprising goblins. The one who talks did so with gusto and at length, introducing himself as Grundle and his silent compatriot as Chode.
