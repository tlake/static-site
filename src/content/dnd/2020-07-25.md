_**Warning:** this post may contain spoilers for the "Baldur's Gate: Descent Into Avernus" 5e module._

The group had successfully escaped a combat with the narzugon Haruman, and retreated to the relative safety of the Field of Dreams in order to discuss their next course of action. Lulu investigated her fractured memories more closely, and concluded that while she couldn't recall the actual location of Zariel's ring, she remembered two different locations that each played a part in her previous traversals through Avernus to where the ring now lay.

One of these locations is a place where demons are created; a great, black, oily lake. The other location is a place where demons are destroyed - a static, radiant weapon. The Menagerie consulted their map in an attempt to locate any landmarks that might coincide with Lulu's descriptions, and the hollyphant was able to point out two likely places. The great oily lake was likely the massive body of demonic ichor that the party circumnavigated early after their arrival to Avernus, and the weapon looked to be an Eye-of-Sauron landmark far on the other side of the map - across the River Styx, even.

The Menagerie was hesitant to wander about in the vast lake of ichor, and so started brainstorming potential avenues for crossing the Styx. The river, by Lulu's account, stretched at least a dozen miles in width, making flight a potential option as long as the party was willing to abandon their infernal warmachine. Zed briefly entertained the idea of supercharging the demon grinder with a boatload of ichor and rocketing off the peak of Haruman's Hill (also dubbed "Zed's Folly") across the Styx, and with enough balloon packs or a powerful enough levitation spell, it might be possible - though perhaps not advisable. Then Lulu hesitantly offered some further information to the group: Avernus is composed of a non-static geography, and it changes constantly according to some unknowable calculus. Furthermore, locals have learned that more often than not, a journey is governed more by thought and willpower than by traditional navigation, and so it might be possible to discover a route to the radiant weapon - referred to by Lulu as the Demon Zapper - that somehow wouldn't require crossing the Styx.

Horns kicked the demon grinder in to gear, and the group decided to all fix the Demon Zapper firmly in their minds - jk, no they didn't. Many of them did, but several thought of the demonic spawning pools, and a couple even pondered a certain powerful draconic influence. Thus did three landmarks shimmer into view on their horizon - a truly enormous horned, lizardlike skull; a distant sphere emanating a pale light; and a series of black, tar-like smears within jagged fences of bare, crooked trees. Being in command of the vehicle, Horns pointed it towards what was likely the Demon Zapper.

A roiling stormfront boiled out of the sky behind the Menagerie and quickly overtook them despite their speed. Warm, thick blood poured out of the clouds, and only Gimble decided to hide in the vehicle's cargo bay. The rest of the group became drenched in the fluid - even within the cover of the helm, the blood sluiced down between the slits in the iron that lend protection to the cockpit. When the bloodstorm had passed, only the Demon Zapper was visible - and it was closer - and Gimble tried to prestidigitate the blood off of the vehicle, and succeeded only partially; a lot of the liquid was magically evaporated, but it left behind a sticky, cooked-on residue.

The Menagerie pulled up to the Demon Zapper. A ten-foot sphere hung fifty feet in the air, and rusty-looking supports resembling the mandibles of some great beetle reached up from the blasted earth towards the sphere. Within the sphere, the group could make out the figure of a unicorn; static, unmoving. Movement on the other side of the grounds attracted the group's attention, and a hulking gorilla-like demon lumbered towards the sphere. The sphere brightened in illumination and a five-foot-thick beam of radiant energy lanced out from it, burning the demon away to ash.

Zed and Horns attempted to communicate with the unicorn, but the creature remained in stasis. Gimble spent some time studying the structure of the weapon, and concluded that the unicorn was definitely the source of the radiant energy. Furthermore, the iron structure around the sphere acted as a conduit for the energies sustaining the sphere, evidently stemming from Avernus itself; it seemed like the only way to disrupt the sphere would be to destroy the stabilizing structures.

The party spent some time debating the ethics of freeing the unicorn from its prison vs destroying a powerful weapon against demonic invasion; there was an argument against meddling at all due to their last experience with interfering at Haruman's Hill, and an argument in favor of just seeing what would shake out if the group started fucking with shit. Eventually boredom won out over caution, and Oneshoe smashed the demon grinder's wrecking ball into one of the supports. This elicited a rumbling sound from beneath the ground, drawing closer to the group, and so Oneshoe smashed it again. Up from the earth below the sphere arose a figure, dark and stony of skin, clutching a warhammer. Where legs should have been was instead a small cyclone, and the creature began to cast a spell. Before the party could form an attack, Gimble recognized the spell as tongues and warned the group to hold off.

The creature introduced itself as Ralzala, and demanded to know why the group was attempting to demolish the weapon. Gimble recalled that this creature was a dao - a genie native to the elemental plane of Earth, frequently greedy and malicious. The dao revealed that should the party continue with their assault, she would be compelled to destroy them, and the group inquired more into the nature of this compulsion. In eons past, Ralzala had entered into a pact with Zariel in exchange for revenge against a rival dao. Since then, she has been bound to the defense of this weapon, and would very much like to find a way to break her pact. She knows of an oracle named Red Ruth, and suspects that if anyone could divine a way around her pact, she could - however, the nature of her compulsion prevents her from leaving the Demon Zapper to go ask Red Ruth herself. If the party is able to retrieve a way to break the pact from Red Ruth, Ralzala would be able to provide them with a letter of introduction to Bel - Zariel's second in command, the former Archduke of Avernus, who is secretly vying for an avenue to reclaim his seat. Such an ally would certainly be able to help the party further their goals. Additionally, if Ralzala is freed from her duty, she would not be compelled to fight the Menagerie should they desire to free the unicorn from its weaponized prison.

Ralzala points the group in the direction of Red Ruth's domain: a place called the Bone Brambles. It's a vast thicket of what used to be part of the Feywild, before Red Ruth corrupted and twisted it, which allowed the locale to be pulled into Avernus. Horns kicked the demon grinder to roaring life again and put the Demon Zapper in his rearview mirror.

Perhaps an hour later, the Bone Brambles came into view. A great thicket of pale, petrified-looking brambles, twisting and intertwined into an unnavigable fortress fifty or sixty feet tall, covered by a dense canopy of rust-colored leaves. There were a couple of breaks in the brambles - no more than ten feet in diameter - where paths led into the dark thicket. The demon grinder and Bullwinkle had to be left outside, and Gimble sent Luna up to just circle the thicket while the group was inside.

Finn took the lead in navigating the party through the narrow, lightless passages within the brambles. Thorny branches tore at the group's skin and clothing, vines and roots caused the group to stumble - as if the thicket itself was possessed of some sort of malicious sentience. At length, Finn led the group along a trail that opened into a small, dead-end of a room within the brambles; at the far side, impaled upon the thorns, was the body of a drow. The party determined that the creature had been dead for a very long time, but its rate of decay was much slower than anticipated. In fact, the drow seemed drained of fluid; a dried-out husk.

Around the drow's body was a strap, and Zed and Horns worked together to pull the body from the brambles. The thicket resisted, but ultimately gave up the corpse after digging a gouge in Zed's skin and absorbing some of his blood. The strap was attached to a colorful bag that looked similar to the party's bag of holding and Oneshoe volunteered to find out what was in this one. She reached her hand in and was pulled halfway into the bag as some toothy maw clutched and tugged at her forearm, but managed to quickly dislocate her thumb and collapse her hand to yank it out of the bag. Her arm was bleeding profusely from several long gashes torn into it, but she was alive.
