_I've fought through the haze for what I fear will be the last time. I hope there remain moments enough to draft this warning and to scatter it far enough beyond my reach._

_I can no longer remember much of my life before my Queen. In the beginning - when I was still... Ralain? - I recall fighting against the fungal hallucinations. It was overwhelming, too much information devoid of structure. Colors for which I had no name. A barrage of consciousnesses hammering against my own, piercing, inquisitive, penetrating, unstoppable. Inviting. Welcoming. Generous, joyful, enthusiastic, loving. They brought me to Her, in Her balmy, tranquil realm. In that dark, quiet place, away from the searing light, away from the cacophanous tumult. ~~We rejoiced~~_

_She is insidious, barely recognizable as a threat. If She has a grand design, I do not know it. She seems merely a placid force of nature, part of the gentle cycle of all life, and this is what makes Her such a danger. She is the soft hand of decomposition and regrowth, of breaking down and building up. As all things must succumb to decay, she is the delicate sweetness within the rot. If left unchecked, She will surely enfold the planes within her ~~serene~~ ~~blissful~~ grasp. She is soothing. She seeks no conquest. She takes nothing by force. She gives comfort, peace, and a connection so rapturous, so warm. She only wants to free us from our fear, from our pain, from our tortuous solitude. She is beautiful! She is divine!_

_I don't know for how long I've been absent. I don't know how many years I've floated within that dreamy melding, with Her, with us. I don't know what town this is, but it doesn't matter. Every time I've fought free of the euphoric fog of our shared consciousness, every time I've managed to reclaim my own self, I've felt a ghastly, hideous loneliness. Even now, writing, I am covered with a cold sweat, possessed of a panic and ajbect horror at the physical act of individuality. I want to go back. You could never imagine what it's like to be so closely intertwined with so many others. To give and receive delight, love, and harmony in the purest chemical forms, unhindered, undiluted, unhampered by words or thought. To have no barriers standing between you and Her. To interface with another consciousness directly, not through the numb, unwieldy proxy of flesh._

_What's left of my own body is a nightmare to me. Where I still have ligaments, I feel them writhe like worms. I can hear the bending of my cartilage. The pumping of my own blood thunders in my ears, too fast, too loud, too fast, an incessant pulse that won't shut up. my bones are too rigid I am a scarecrow full of sticks puppeteered by flesh but I will return to Her and soon I can be rid of this abhorrent form and I can be rid of this empty existence where it's too bright and I miss the dark i miss the spores i miss the warmth i miss the damp i miss the dark i miss Her i miss Her i miss Her ~~I MISS HER~~_

_I am sorry. The dread I feel when I am without them has become too difficult to bear. ~~I wish you could join us~~ She is largely bound deep within the Abyss, cultivating and growing Her garden wherever it is possible to do so. She does not seek to invade the Material plane, nor any other. But I do. I weep for you, whose form and existence is intrinsically incapable of experiencing spiritual apotheosis. ~~we~~ I will work to free Her. i will find a way to open the doorway between Her realm and yours. i will set Her spores adrift in glorious clouds, the better to expand the borders of Her conservatory_

_i hope you can stop us_

_when I am inevitably lost once more, i will try and destroy this warning. with luck, I can prevent myself from doing so. If you find it, i hope you can halt Her creeping influence. halt the corruption ~~embrace her blessing~~ warn the keepers warn the jade arbor_

_forgive ~~me~~ ~~us~~ me_

_~~ratharlen~~_

_~~raithen~~ no_
