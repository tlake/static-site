title: Paper Crane Letter to Gray

---

_I pray the missive I received was a cruel joke by some nameless charlatan, for I had thought my mourning finished. I pray this letter finds no home, but drifts upon the wind, forever undelivered._

_It is not safe for you to contact me like this._

_It is not safe for you to be alive._
