---

> In the blue camhanaich all shimmering still  
> Dame Calluna, low Lady of the Hills  
> Cup of cold sun and a winterpill  
> Send me back on my way  
> Seven black rabbits of Hy-Brasil  
> Twenty-one petals of daffodils  
> Thirteenth note of the blackcap trill  
> Iâ€™ll fly home today  

_song by Allison Russell_
