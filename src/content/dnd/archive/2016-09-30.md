- Grey went unconscious and lost a hand to ghoul dinner
- Val spiderclimbed a wall and threw Finn at a ghoul, which exploded
- Bailey and Not Bailey both went unconscious
- Lots of paralysis happening
- Concerted effort of Val's + Horns' healing, potion from Gimble, and kazoo from Finn reattached Grey's mangled hand... but to what effect?
- Talked past a potential battle with five bugbears
- Left cave for Phandalin and some supplies
