(Finn, Gimble, Gray, Horns, Val)

- Horns learned about poisonous fungus
- Fought a bunch of ghouls
- Gray went unconscious and lost a hand to ghoul dinner
- Val spiderclimbed a wall and threw Finn at a ghoul, which exploded
- Bailey and Not Bailey both went unconscious
- Lots of paralysis happening
- Concerted effort of Val's + Horns' healing, potion from Gimble, and kazoo from Finn reattached Gray's mangled hand... but to what effect?
- Talked past a potential battle with five bugbears
- Left cave for Phandalin and some supplies
