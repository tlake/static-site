07: With Great Power Comes Great Irresponsibility (2016-07-29)

- Party rescues Gimble from the castle and beings the journey back to Phandalin
- Party defeats a wandering Ogre
- Nighttime ambush by a pack of marauding Gnolls
- A careless _flaming sphere_ from Gimble starts a wildfire that sweeps northeast along the Triboar trail; the party runs from the fire for a day
- ""The sky is tinged with regret.""
