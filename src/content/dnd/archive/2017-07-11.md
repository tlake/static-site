33: The Katabasis, Part 2 (2017-07-11)

(Finn, Gimble, Hael, Horns, Val)

_20 Uktar 1491 DR_

The battle into the heart of the caldera of Mt. Hotenow continues! The party continues to fight down heavy black iron steps and across swaying chain bridges. Finn climbs onto the back of Reidoth, who uses _Wild Shape_ to turn into a giant owl, and together they engage in dogfighting with the spined devils that harass The Menagerie from the air. Haeltin finds success in dropping non-flying devils from great heights to impact upon the lava or iron far below. Horns and Val have somewhat less success with similar tactics, and Gimble bravely uses _mage hand_ to keep a torch thirty feet in front of him.

The heat grows more intense as they continue to descend, and the party begins to discern the fiends that stand guard at the mouth of the massive obsidian portal itself...
