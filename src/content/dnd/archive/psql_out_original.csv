import campaign,"_""The sky is gray and tinged with regret.""_
### 

`import campaign` is a Seattle-based fifth-edition _Dungeons & Dragons_ campaign run by a Python developer for several other Python developers (...plus a couple folks who aren't). The campaign started out taking the players through the _Lost Mines of Phandelver_ module, and is now going off the rails into custom content.

We meet every other Friday, and sometimes we'll tweet about it with [#importcampaign](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23importcampaign&src=typd).

### Lyra Farsong
- Race: Human
- Location: ???

The sole survivor after a marauding orcish band killed her journeying family, 12-year-old Lyra was imprisoned by those same orcs alongside Val. After the party freed her in Leaffall of 1491 DR, the traumatized girl was sent to live with her aunt [Emily](#wiki-toc-emily-taryn) and uncle [Blinn](#wiki-toc-blinn-taryn) in Neverwinter (after she was almost stolen away by sprites).

Later in The Rotting of that year when the party visited Neverwinter, Val checked in on Lyra and learned from her distraught aunt that the girl had been taken out for lunch two weeks prior by Val (or at least, someone that looked like Val) and never returned.


### Sildar Hallwinter
- Race: Human
- Occupation: Officer in the Lord's Alliance
- Location: Phandalin

Was rescued from goblins by _The Menagerie_; currently spending time in Phandalin in an attempt to guide the town's growth and recovery after the Rebdrand occupation and the reopening of the lost mine in Wave Echo Cave.


### Trynna Briegarden
- Race: Halfling
- Occupation: Merchant, Tinkerer
- Location: Neverwinter

- [Reidoth](../non-player-characters/#wiki-toc-reidoth) has something very important to tell the party
    - 30 years ago, the activity in Mt. Hotenow was the result of a host of devils from the Nine Hells coming through a portal from Avernus.
    - The Emerald Enclave was able to drive back the host, but not without suffering great losses themselves.
    - With help from those who remained of the Enclave, Reidoth was able to bind the commander of the host into a magical prison and sink it in the waters off of the Sword Coast.
    - A little over a year ago, Horns washed up on the shore. With his memory and devilish existence sapped away by time, water, and magic, he was taken in by Reidoth and began to learn the druidic arts.
- Upset and unsure of himself, Horns took a walk and some time before being convinced to return to Reidoth's cottage, where the old druid continues
    - A dark, familiar energy has become known to Reidoth in recent days, and its source seems to be Mt. Hotenow.
    - Reidoth is convinced that the host has been rebuilding the portal and means to pour into Faerûn once more.
    - With the Enclave still diminished, Reidoth proposes that a preemptive surgical strike has the greatest chance for success; he asks that party reconvenes in Thundertree in a few days' time to accompany him into the caldera of the mountain, where he can hold open the portal long enough for the party to run into Avernus and destroy the portal's anchor in the Nine Hells.
- Once agreed, the party makes tracks for Neverwinter.
- Luna returns to Gimble from her own journey to Neverwinter bearing a note from [Sildar](../non-player-characters/#wiki-toc-sildar-hallwinter)
    - The note explains that Sildar is in Neverwinter following the deliverance of [Iarno](../non-player-characters/#wiki-toc-iarno)'s body and the two Redbrands into the justice of the city. He mentions that he has a gift for them, should they find themselves in Neverwinter.
- During Finn's watch that night, she notices a dark shape with pinpoints of bright light approach her - it's StarBailey!
- Finn casts _speak with animals_ and greets the celestial wolf, who tells her to stay.
- She obliges, and Zane's screams rip through the night as some lupine humanoid sinks its claws into Zane's chest.
    - The beast has dark gray skin and pale white fur/hair. Tattoos of wolves adorn both of its arms and back, vibrant with watercolor hues.
- Before Zane loses consciousness, he expresses recognition of the creature; it then closes its muzzle around Zane's throat and tears it away.
- Gray the werewolf then turns to attack Finn; StarBailey bids a final farewell to the halfling barbarian and leaps at Gray, her celestial form disappearing into Gray's torso.
- Gray falls unconscious and reverts to his half-drow form, naked, with a large tattoo of Bailey on his chest.
- The party is unable to pull Gray into consciousness until the sun rises, at which point he comes out of it himself. To the south, a small meteorite falls into the grasslands.
- Along the way to Neverwinter, they come upon the impact site and find what is essentially a scimitar, cold, black, and forged from starmetal."

The party takes a couple of days in Neverwinter to obtain supplies and take care of some things before they make their journey into the Nine Hells of Baator:

- [Sildar](../non-player-characters/#wiki-toc-sildar-hallwinter) needs the name of an individual or collective in order to sign over the deed to Tresendar Manor and its grounds, and the party settles upon the moniker of ""The Menagerie.""
- Horns commissions some scale mail to be made from the scales of Venomfang, the young green dragon, from [Melga](../non-player-characters/#wiki-toc-melga-proudshield); the armor won't be ready for at least a week, and the final price is unknown but due on pickup (50gp paid in advance).
- Dragon parts are sold to the Neverwinter Mage's Guild Outlet Store, and some potions are also acquired.
- Val goes to check up on [Lyra](../non-player-characters/#wiki-toc-lyra), and her aunt [Edith](../non-player-characters/#wiki-toc-edith) collapses into tears. It seems that a week prior, Val (or at least, someone who looked like Val) came to take Lyra out for lunch, and they haven't been seen since.
- Val learns about SaaS (spellcasting as a service) from [Woodard](../non-player-characters/#wiki-toc-woodard) of the Neverwinter Mages' Guild and discovers how expensive it would be for someone to cast a scrying spell.
- The party asks the Thieves' Guild in Neverwinter to conduct a search, but opts not to progress past the paywall.
- Hael spends a night with [Lily](../non-player-characters/#wiki-toc-lily-ashewood), and Finn and [Jon](../non-player-characters/#wiki-toc-jon) have a very awkward dinner date.
- Gimble acquires some arcane foci from [Alara](../non-player-characters/#wiki-toc-alara)'s oddities shop.

With their business concluded, the Menagerie set out in the year's first snowfall to meet up with [Reidoth](../non-player-characters/#wiki-toc-reidoth) once more in Thundertree, and begin their ascent of Mt. Hotenow.

Reidoth leads them to the exit of a lava tube partway up the mountain, saving them from trying to scale Hotenow's upper half. The tube is guarded by an abominable yeti, but a veritable menagerie of _conjure animals_ puts the beast to rest."
"32: The Katabasis, Part 1 (2017-06-16)","(Finn, Gimble, Gorstag, Hael, Horns, Val)

_20 Uktar 1491 DR_

The Menagerie spends the night in the mouth of the lava tube that opens up onto the side of Mt. Hotenow. In the morning, they discover a small collection of shiny things that was the yeti's hoard. Some of these things are useless junk, like broken vials or scraps of bent metal. Others are items like gold coins, a few mundane weapons, and a +1 _Wand of the War Caster._ They begin to progress into the tunnel, and Gorstag soon catches them up.

Led by Reidoth, they snake further and further into the dark tunnel, and they discuss plans and possibilities. Hael spends a few moments trying to connect with the Nameless Wolf, and the deity suffuses his essence with purpose, and anticipation of the hunt.

The hours pass and the tunnel slowly grows warmer as they draw closer to the volcanic heart of the mountain. In the distance, they see the glow of distant lava as the tube opens up onto the upper caldera, and silhouetted against its light are two devilish figures. Horns' _pass without a trace_ allows the Menagerie a surprise round, and then some amount of hell begins to break loose.

Our ""heroes"" manage to gain a view of the caldera as they move into combat. A great spiral staircase twists slowly downward around the ever-widening conical walls of the caldera chamber, each step a solid block of black iron pounded into the very rock. Scattered around the cavern also are various outposts of the same decor, suspended from the stone of the mountain by heavy iron beams. Several of these structures are connected by swaying chain-and-grate bridges, cris-crossing the open middle of the chamber.

The start of the battle is in the party's favor, as only a handful of devils are in close proximity to the tunnel. However, it's not long before the alarm is raised and more fiends begin mounting an offense against the intrepid adventurers. Bearded devils begin to charge up the staircase, brandishing poisonous tentacles and infernal glaives; spined devils take to the air on leathern wings and harry the party with tail-flung spikes from a distance; barbed devils can take a beating and hurl balls of fire. The Menagerie is (mostly) undaunted - Val spider-climbs on the wall and summons boars; Hael's form shifts into that of a werewolf and he tosses devils into the lava far below; Finn, Gorstag, and Horns the polar bear present a powerful frontline; Gimble does his level best to be helpful without also being exposed; and old man Reidoth clocks a few devils with his trusty _shillelagh_'d quarterstaff.

The incursion has only just begun, however. The strength of the fiendish garrison is yet unknown, and it's a long way down."

The battle into the heart of the caldera of Mt. Hotenow continues! The party continues to fight down heavy black iron steps and across swaying chain bridges. Finn climbs onto the back of Reidoth, who uses _Wild Shape_ to turn into a giant owl, and together they engage in dogfighting with the spined devils that harass The Menagerie from the air. Haeltin finds success in dropping non-flying devils from great heights to impact upon the lava or iron far below. Horns and Val have somewhat less success with similar tactics, and Gimble bravely uses _mage hand_ to keep a torch thirty feet in front of him.

The heat grows more intense as they continue to descend, and the party begins to discern the fiends that stand guard at the mouth of the massive obsidian portal itself..."

_20 Uktar 1491 DR_

The party presses further downward into the volcanic heart of Mt. Hotenow, harried by devils every step of the way. The human barbarian Ivor finally manages to catch up to the group, joining the fray by leaping from bridges above onto a spined devil. Hael continues his tradition of tossing enemies from heights, Horns continues _his_ tradition of calling lightning, and Gimble webs a couple of flyers to the staircase. A spined devil deals enough damage to Reidoth's great owl form to break the spell, and both he and Finn plummet towards an iron doom. He manages to burn his final _wild shape_, Finn scrambles back onboard the large bird, and the two of them narrowly avoid pancaking. Val discovers a gorgon guarding an armory room, and nopes right the hell out (the gorgon doesn't give chase).

The party soon comes to the bottom of the caldera - to the gargantuan slab of black iron floating upon a lake of magma. Here sits the portal, guarded by a chain devil, a chained tanarukk, and a small contingent of lesser devils. Horns parlays with the chain devil, and tries to pull rank as a former general. The chain devil rebuffs him, however, citing the current general's power, and informs the party that they have two choices: leave, or die.

Val summons a tidal wave, Reidoth joins Horns in calling down lightning, and the Menagerie rushes the platform..."
"35: The Katabasis, Part 4 (2017-08-25)","(Finn, Hael, Horns, Ivor, Val)

_20 Uktar 1491 DR_

The party's front line rushes towards the platform at the bottom of the stairs, while Horns and Reidoth remain on a bridge above, calling down lightning on the devils. The two spined devils take to the air, but the chain devil hooks one of them and drags it back to itself. After issuing a hurried command, the chain devil hurls the spined devil through the portal. Six bearded devils dive into the magma and disappear beneath the surface, the chain devil releases the bonds of the tanarukk, and the pair of barbed devils hurl balls of flame at the party.

As the bearded devils emerge from the lava and begin to charge up the staircase, Val summons forth a small host of giant toads, and the chain devil animates several of the thick chains hanging about. Between the toads and the chains, the majority of both sides of the battle end up restrained on the black iron steps.

Finn falls unconscious once or twice, but eventually the party prevails and the devils disappear in clouds of black, sulfurous vapor. The tanarukk lies dead and bleeding on the steps, and Val claims its crude, inelegant greatsword for herself.

The Menagerie approaches the portal - an imposing obsidian construction, its 10' x 10' frame surrounds a space 20' wide and 30' high. At its top, jagged obsidian embellishments curl upward to cradle a transparent, spectral orb full of an inky blackness; occasionally, a ghostly face twisted in a silent scream emerges from the dark and fades back into it. The portal itself is like a black velvet fabric stretched to the edges of the frame, shot through with twisting flecks of red light.

Reidoth produces a smooth, pale rod; it looks like birchwood, with a green crystal embedded into each end. He twists it apart at the center and hands one half to Horns, telling him that the bond between the rods is what should allow him to keep the portal from collapsing once it's been destroyed from the other side. He wishes the party good luck, and drinks a potion of invisibility.

The Menagerie spend a few moments preparing themselves, then - battered and bruised - step into the portal."
36: The Mission (2017-09-08),"(Finn, Gimble, Hael, Horns, Ivor, Val)

_20-21 Uktar 1491 DR?_

There is no sense of time within the portal, and after-images from everything the characters look at remain imprinted on their eyes. After seconds? minutes? they emerge from the portal, no longer on the Material Plane. They are greeted by the black, cloudless sky of Avernus, the first level of the Nine Hells of Baator, from which rain down burning comets and meteorites. The landscape is a blasted wasteland, barren and rocky, and littered with long-rusted weapons and bones from countless battles. The scent of sulfur is omnipresent, and the occasional river of blood churns its way throughout the land.

On this side of the portal, the translucent orb from the Material Plane is mirrored at the frame's top, only it's not translucent here. The orb is solid and real, and seems to be the source of the portal's power.

In front of the portal and party is a small village, sparsely constructed of rough wood and iron. It seems to be a staging area for a small army to gather and make preparations before entering the massive portal, and is currently empty. However, a small horde of devils can be seen in the distance - many of them fliers - charging full-bore towards the portal. It seems the spined devil that the chained devil flung through the portal has successfully raised an alarm.

Val takes up a defensive position in the village; Gimble creates an illusory wall off from the portal, and he, Finn, and Not-Bailey take cover behind it. The small idol Horns had been holding is no longer present, and he seems to be acting strangely. Hael tackles him to the ground.

Hails of spines from the devils begins to pepper the party, and Horns tells Ivor that the rod's energies should be able to interrupt the orb. Gimble casts _spider climb_ on Ivor, who charges up to the top of the portal and golf-swings the rod against the sphere. It causes a crack, and some of the inky blackness begins to spill out in a heavy fog.

The horde is almost upon them, and Horns convinces Hael to let him up. Amid a rain of spines, Horns raises a hand and shouts something in infernal, briefly outlined in a dim red glow; a full half of the imminent fliers shriek and flee.

Ivor connects with another swing, and a thunderous boom echoes across the ruined lands; the sphere shatters and the heavy black fog contained within cascades downward as it dissipates. Ivor is thrown from the top of the portal, and he drops the rod, which has also suffered some damage; the green gem is cracked but not shattered, and the wood around the gem is blackened and charred. Small sparks of energy occasionally lance out from the gem's seating.

With the orb destroyed, the fabric of the portal begins to detach and pull away from the obsidian frame. Horns picks up the rod, the devils close in, and the party begins to make for the portal; Ivor and Not-Bailey are the first through.

Suddenly, a wall of fire erupts in front of the portal, and a pit fiend slams into the ground.

Horns _wild shapes_ into a giant elk and charges the pit fiend, who catches the animal by its antlers. The rest of the party decide that fleeing through the portal is of utmost importance; one by one, they hurl themselves through the burning wall and land unconscious on the other side at the mouth of the portal, where Ivor is able to revive them with goodberries. As the only one left on Avernus, and the bearer of the rod, Horns disengages with the pit fiend and flings himself through the fire as well.

As the party gathers in the space between worlds, they realize that they need to make haste as the portal begins to destabilize around them; with the soul-orb that was powering the portal destroyed and the rod damaged, it's uncertain for how long the portal will stand. They rush towards the light that marks the other end of the portal and careen out of it into... a forest?

The sky is a soft lavender, and the colors in the forest are... _more_ than any forest they've experienced before. It's not that there are more shades of green, or that things are very brightly-colored; it's more like the green is just more green, as if the green that they know is a descendant of this green.

Finn, carrying the axe _Hew_, feels very discomfited, and the trees seem vaguely ominous to her until she stows the weapon in the party's bag of holding.

The forest seems safe, if a little quiet, and so the party decides that they need to rest. When they awake, the sky has not changed, and Val casts _speak with plants_ to try and figure out where they've landed. It soon becomes apparent that the group is not on the Material Plane, but in the Feywild, and the closest city is probably an ancient city called Mithrendain."
Interlude: The Tomb of Gauntletvania (2017-10-06),""
37: Feywild 101 (2017-10-20),"The dusky lavender of twilight is still painted across the sky of the Feywild as the Menagerie stirs from their rest after falling into this new plane. Without warning, Haeltin disappears from the group; his companions are unable to trace his steps, and so they make their way to the edge of the forest.

As the trees give way to the long grasses of a hilly plain, they notice a small bit of smoke curling up from the end of a tiny cooking fire, attended to by an anthropomorphic fox. As they begin to approach, another arm of the destabilized portal opens in the sky, just long enough to cough a confused Gorstag into the Feywild, who lands unceremoniously by the campfire and frightens the Baator out of the fox. The party approaches, introduces themselves, calm the foxman, and learn that he is Caerwyn Cadogan, a traveling merchant of sorts. Caerwyn offers some of his meager stew to the group when Haeltin silently rejoins the group; unnoticed, he places his hand on Caerwyn's head and frightens the creature again.

The party learns that Caerwyn is of a race known as the tuathan, and after some conversation and soothing of Caerwyn's nerves, he asks if they had found ""her"". Noticing their confusion, he explains that they are currently in the Jeph Wilds, and that the forest is the home of the Reticent Mountain. Indeed, while the party is able to see the mountain from outside of the forest, attempts to glimpse it from within the woods are doomed to failure.

Caerwyn gives the party a very brief crash course on how to survive the Feywild: namely, by not pissing off any powerful fey or their servants. He teaches them a rhyme, should they walk into a chance encounter with any such entity while traveling:

_""Beneath the sun or falling rain, I yield to thee thy path again.""_

Gimble, intrigued by Caerwyn's declaration of merchant occupation, asks to see some of the tuathan's wares, and Caerwyn gladly obliges. After some display, a faerie puppet (and the accompanying command word) is sold to Finn for a few gold, and Gimble offers to trade one of Trynna's magical soaps to Caerwyn for a small favor. Impressed at how quickly the gnome seems to be adapting to life in the Feywild, Caerwyn accepts; the deal is one minor favor, and it expires after a year and a day.

The tuathan also makes mention of the Court of Stars, conducted by Queen Titania of the Summer Court and set to convene in a handful of days in the lofty reaches of High Senaliesse, a city built in the tops of the titanic white trees of the forest of the same name. Noticing Haeltin's drow lineage, Caerwyn recommends against requesting aid from the relatively-nearby eladrin city of Mithrendain, stating that while the eladrin that dwell there are powerful and good, time passes slowly and those eladrin are still strongly effected by the emotions which echo from the time when the progenitor elven race was torn into three - the betrayer drow, which were driven underground, the sun elves, which departed for the Material Plane, and the eladrin, which remained in the Feywild.

Caerwyn tells the party that he's going to the Court of Stars, and offers to let them accompany him. They accept, and they set out together.

After a cycle of rest (during which the sky never changes, and during which Finn plays kazoo while Caerwyn accompanies on lute), they come across a large flower in the woods of the Jeph Wilds, petals surrounding a surprisingly deep pool. After the party conducts some investigation, Caerwyn tosses a coin into the pool. Moments later, a beautiful, nude woman surfaces from the depths with a large gem and asks if anyone had dropped it. Ivor immediately lays claim to it, and the woman frowns at his blatant lie. She introduces herself as Nessa, and the party learns that she trades gems for minor magical enhancements (she does this for free, should a traveler prove honest in her test). for a few hundred GP worth of gems, she bestows _+1_ status to Val's shortbow and Gorstag's greatsword before the party continues on their way.

After another arbitrary day or two, the Menagerie wanders into an ambush from the boughs above. Haeltin's heightened senses of smell and hearing allow him to determine that this ""ambush"" is set by only two creatures. After a bit of parleying, the ambushers reveal themselves: a goblin, dressed in a shabby, too-large tunic that once dreamt of being green and an oversized cap who calls himself Goblin Hood, and an orc, wearing a similar but much-too-small cap who introduces himself as Bruce before being overriden in his introduction by the goblin as Little John. Goblin Hood refers to quotes from a beat-up copy of Robin Hood (read backwards and backwards by the goblin) to guide how he should react in this situation.

As it becomes apparent that the party will not consent to being robbed from in order to be fed to the poor, Goblin Hood confers upon them the honor of being members of his Merry Men, and departs upon the shoulders of the apologetic orc."
38: The Bookwyrm (2017-11-04),"Some time after parting ways with Goblin Hood and his Little John, Haeltin's nose picks up a rather familiar scent, and his ears detect footfalls. Before long, the orc Bruce catches up with them (with the goblin still on his shoulders) with a plea for their aid. Goblin Hood tells them that a patrol from his clan found the two of them and took his book away in order to deliver it to The Parchment. Goblin Hood explains that The Parchment is a mysterious being that lives at the top of the tower of the Thoughstealer goblin tribe's encampment. While no goblin has ever seen The Parchment, they know that it is powerful and that it keeps the tribe safe from external threats as long as they maintain a tithe of literature - mundane books, of course, but magical scrolls are highly prized as well. Citing the party's membership as his Merry Men (though they did not consent to such a title), Goblin Hood all but demands they help him recover his lost belonging, in exchange for what he calls his greatest treasure.

Curious, the Menagerie agree, and they set out towards the Throughtstealer tribe. Along the way, they pass by a broken wagon with neither horse nor occupant. Goblin Hood explains that his tribe knocked off that wagon earlier that day, drove off its owners, stole the horse, and looted the cart of food, valuables, and literature.

As they draw near to the Thoughtstealer encampment, Caerwyn and Bruce each opt to remain distant from the outpost. The home of the Thoughtstealer tribe is a muddy patch of earth surrounded by a perimeter of thick wooden stakes, anchored into the ground and sharpened at the top. An ancient tower in disrepair stands at a jaunty angle in the center of the encampment.

Initially, two goblin guards deny entrance to all the party except for Goblin Hood, whose real name is revealed to be Ripsnak. Haeltin engages one guard in an act of lethal persuasion involving a rock, and ""convinces"" the other guard to let them through. With sufficient intimidation, the party is able to escort Ripsnak directly through the encampment to the base of the tower, where two more guards nervously let them pass.

The entrance to the tower is not a proper door; rather, the tower has sunk into the earth over countless years, and several rough planks of wood have been fitted over a window which is now ground-height. The window opens onto a spiral staircase; to the left, as the stairs descend into the soil, the stairwell soon becomes blocked with earth and stone. To the right they continue upward, ending in a small stone landing in front of an old, iron-bound, wooden door. The group learns that the door is both locked and protected by magic, and the booming voice of The Parchment demands that they leave. After some negotiation, Gimble persuades the creature to let them in exchange for some rare literature.

The door opens of its own accord and reveals a round room that was must have been a study long ago. Bookshelves line the walls, and a pair of tattered, overstuffed chairs and an old desk rest upon a faded circular rug. A few orbs of arcane light float near the ceiling and provide illumination. And yet, the room is empty of inhabitants.

A few of the party members begin to glance at the tomes on the shelves, and they discover that most of the books are empty - front and back covers connected by a spine, but with no pages between. After a bit more conversation with the disembodied voice of The Parchment, a rustling begins to emanate from a few volumes on a bookshelf. An old piece of yellowed vellum that has been folded upon itself over and over again slips out from between two books, and it unfolds itself as it begins to fall. The paper's fall becomes a glide, and then a flight, as the paper finishes its creased expansion into an origami dragon about the size of a housecat. Nearly the entirety of its papery skin is inked with the glowing blue runes and phrases of spellcraft, and the creature formally introduces themself as The Parchment.

_The Parchment had lived in this tower for as long as they can remember. While they never knew the wizard that created them, they learned about him - and more importantly, his magic - from journals and notes that he had scribed and kept stored in the study. In solitude, the Parchment learned to cast protective spells on the study; indeed, the party learned that many magics wouldn't function in this room - especially fire magic, which is particularly threatening to a being made of dry plant fibers. It was because of this very lack of protection in the outside world that the paper dragon decided it would remain in the tower. Paper goods are the dragon's source of nutrition, however, and the stores in the study could only hold out for so long._

_When a goblin tribe set up a temporary camp near the tower, The Parchment used their magic to hail the goblins in a voice that would be intimidating enough to awe the creatures, but not so frightening as to drive them away in terror. They struck a deal with the tribe - The Parchment would allow the goblins to create a permanent encampment around the tower and would protect it with all of their magical prowess. In exchange, the goblins would never try to enter the study, and in addition to the provisions and valuables they looted from natural raids and excursions, they would also deliver any paper and literature (both magical and mundane) that they should come across to the landing outside of The Parchment's door. Under this new modus operandi, the superstitious goblins came to call themselves the Thoughtstealers, and to worship the unknown being in the tower as a local deity._


At length, the Menagerie and the paper drake come around to the original matter of the visit: a literary transaction. In exchange for Gimble's _scroll of fireball_ and a couple of Hael's dwarven history books, The Parchment returns ""Robin Hood"" to Ripsnak (who is very excited about the entire situation). And to make up for the disparity in the trade, The Parchment offers for the party to look around the study for something to make the trade equal. At the end of it all, Hael obtains a _figurine of wondrous power_ (a bronze statuette of a griffon with the ability to transform into a real, true-sized griffon), and Val finds a _wand of wonder_ (a gaudy golden wand with colorful gems and baubles which casts random magic).

As they bid each other farewell, The Parchment bestows a final gift upon Ripsnak: an old, tattered wizard's hat that once belonged to their creator, and the title of ""Official Liaison to The Parchment."" Ripsnak has become the only goblin ever granted permission to enter the sanctum of the tribe's mystical protector.

(The hat is absolutely far too large for the little goblin.)

Goblin Hood, proud and puffed up with importance, leads his merry band of bonded adventurers back out of the encampment - at least, until Hael reminds him of his promise of payment; Ripsnak's ""most precious possession."" Having completely forgotten about it, Ripsnak immediately changes pace and marches through his muddy village to his home - partly a mound of dried mud, and partly a hole scratched into the earth, Ripsnak is very proud of it. Moments later, he emerges with a squat glass bottle, stoppered with a cork worn from frequent use. A thick, greasy, lard-like substance is contained within, brownish-yellow in color.

""Griffon grease!"" Ripsnak exclaims, handing it up to the half-elf. ""The smell sometimes helps me to sleep at night.""

With prizes in hand, the group leaves the encampment and rendezvous with Caerwyn and Bruce in the outskirts. Ripsnak and Bruce bid the adventurers farewell, and the Menagerie set off once more with their Tuathan guide."

"43: Fomorian Forward Camp, Part 1 (2018-03-09)","The Menagerie stands at the mouth of a large tunnel, its entrance a static eruption of earth and stone. The slope is not gradual, but also not steep enough to hinder movement. The tunnel maintains a rough average of thirty feet in both width and height, and the earth is densely packed from the comings and goings of a small army. Haeltin's heightened senses detect Anastrianna's scent among that of many orogs leading into the cavern, so the party begins their descent; everyone is on foot except for Zed, who sits atop his elk mount, Bullwinkle.

It's evident that the walls of the tunnel have been intentionally worked smooth, yet roots of varying sizes project into the tunnel's interior. These roots are all covered in a thick, gray fungus, and seem very much the worse for it. Hael scrapes some of this fungus into a vial and manages to avoid drawing breath as the stuff enthusiastically throws out spores.

The cavern snakes its way further and deeper into the ground, and the group soon progress far enough into the system to be completely enveloped in pitch darkness. Nearly everyone can see in darkness except for Finn, who affixes her familiar, Sally, to her head and channels her vision through the lizard. After some time, the dim shape of a fortification gate made of sharpened logs is visible just at the edge of the party's vision; at the same time, four crossbow bolts zip out of the darkness and find purchase in Val and Bullwinkle as four Orogs notice the intruders. The party is able to make relatively quick work of the guards, and with the classic combo of Val's _flaming sphere_ and Gimble's _web_, none of them live long enough to escape and raise an alarm.

Beyond the guardpost, the grand tunnel continued on and down, but several smaller tunnels branched off to the sides. Anastrianna's scent continued down the main tunnel, but the orcish smell did as well, stronger and stronger as the tunnel went until finally the party came to a sharp turn in the cavern and the scent of the eladrin was completely overpowered. Hael theorized that the entire orcish host might be nearby, and the group decided to investigate the side branches to ensure that something nasty would not catch them from behind.

The first side tunnel that the party investigates begins to slope upwards for a while, and they discover that it terminates in a ladder up to a trapdoor. The door swings upward on a hinge to reveal a different part of the Murkwood; it seems that the orcish host has multiple muster points from which sorties could depart. They investigate a second tunnel, and find a similar sally point. In the third tunnel, Finn (through Sally's exemplary darkvision) discovers a couple of orogs directing the tunneling efforts of a large creature, possessed of a plated exterior, pointed muzzle, and thick, sharp claws. She retreats, informs the group of this ""rock dog,"" and they elect to try another direction.

In another tunnel, Haeltin catches the scent of something marine; the smell of water, but also of salt, and an undercurrent of something acrid. They come to a cliff that opens up into a large cavern, and spreading out some twenty feet below is a small underground lake - the source of the marine scent. Squinting in the darkness, the group is able to make out hafts of weaponry, ragged clothing scraps, damaged leathers, and dissolving general refuse. It seems like this is where the orcish host dumps their trash, and it seems like it might be dangerous. Zed and Bullwinkle trek back to the guardpost and retrieve a body (christened ""Ted"") to dump into the liquid, and although there isn't a flashy reaction, some sort of acidic effect can be observed. When Ted hits the surface of the water, the movement of something in the distance catches someone's eye, and the Menagerie discovers that what was initially thought to be the back wall of the cavern actually extends for some unknown distance in a jagged passageway. This small corridor extends downward, meaning that the acidic liquid travels through it as well.

More exploration of the cave system results in a tunnel that widens for a few dozen feet into a larger room, littered with weapons and cast-off clothing. Val moves in to acquire one of the cloaks for herself, but the cloak attacks! It unfurls into a large stingray-like creature, leather-cloak-brown on top but pale white underneath, and latches on and envelops Val in a smothering embrace. She _wild shapes_ into a giant elk and breaks the creature's hold, but two other cloaks stir to life and attack the party as well. A memory comes rushing back to Haeltin of his father, who had fought these things once before, and he is able to identify them as ""cloakers"" and warns the party against striking them while they're latched onto an ally. Immediately thereafter, he is enveloped, and Finn uses her wand of _magic missile_ to attack the cloaker, harming Hael in the process. The battle continues, with most of the party focusing on two of the cloakers while the third cloaker and Gimble have a _mirror image_ contest. Gimble burns through most of his luck and arcane reserves, but eventually the Menagerie stand victorious after a hard-won combat."
