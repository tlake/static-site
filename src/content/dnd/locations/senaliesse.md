## Key Info

The name of the forest which houses the Summer Court.

Divided into "Low" and "High":
- Low Senaliesse, the forest floor and undergrowth.
- High Senaliesse, a complex network of bridges and structures made of shaped and grown trees, high in the staggering canopy of the forest. This is where the Court itself resides and gathers.
