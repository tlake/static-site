In the aftermath of the battle for Red Ruth's home, the Menagerie reconvened in Gimble's _tiny hut_ to try for a long rest. After only a couple of hours, Red Ruth came back from her spa treatment looking centuries younger and perfectly willing to divulge to the party her knowledge of how to free Ralzala from her pact with Zariel.

The trick was simply for Ralzala to consume the blood of a titan, and Red Ruth told the group about a titan named Uldrak who, many years ago, attempted to slay Tiamat. He failed, and the Queen of Dragons punished him accordingly. Uldrak wasn't slain, but he was... changed. Red Ruth described his resting place in a valley of ash and explained how to get there, and offered the Menagerie one more opportunity to purchase some of her potions for _soul coins._ They declined, then hopped aboard their trusty _demon grinder_ - recently nicknamed the "Anti-Chrysler."

After a couple hours' travel, their destination loomed upon the horizon - a series of small peaks, rocky and barren, standing sentinel around the borders of a valley. No gouts of fire or flowing magma hinted that this range was volcanic, but many of them vented black ash into the air. The dark flakes settled all around the area; the violent, unpredictable winds of Avernus prevented the outlands from developing a particularly heavy layer of ash, but deep fields and drifts of soot collected within the valley due to the comparatively still air currents.

The _demon grinder_ drove on into the charcoal valley, and eventually the party came upon a peak similar to those that ringed the valley. A large cave had been worn or worked into the side of the peak, and within the hollow rested a battered helm, three or four times the size of any that Zed might hope to wear. Beside the helm was a sword of complementary size, cracked and chipped, and driven into the ground.

The group approached and began investigating the area, and their presence prompted the issuance of a voice from within the helm. It talked to itself as much as it talked to them, and it frequently slipped out of Common and into Giant. Then, a small _spined devil_ emerged, and confirmed to the party that he was indeed Uldrak. It became apparent that Uldrak's current form would not be able to provide the blood of a titan needed to break Ralzala's pact, and in order for him to regain his former glory, he would need to spill Tiamat's blood upon the ground - an ironic requirement, since it was his failure to do so as a titan that bound him to this weakened form.

The party was willing to help, though, and Uldrak took a chance. He gave them the orb from the pommel of his sword and told the Menagerie of a dragonborn named Arkhan who serves the Queen of Dragons, and who carries a reliquary of her blood around his neck. The orb was to be a bargaining chip; if they could acquire the reliquary and return it to Uldrak, he could decant its contents, thus spilling Tiamat's blood upon the ground, thus restoring his titanic form, thus enabling him to gift the party some of his own blood, thus freeing Ralzala from her pact, thus freeing the group to set the unicorn free without needing to fight Ralzala as well as potentially establishing a relationship with Bel by way of Ralzala's introduction.

With Lulu's help, the Menagerie identified what was likely to be Arkhan's tower on the map, and once more took the _demon grinder_ out across Avernus. En route, they were set upon by four large vulture-harpy-like creatures: _vrocks._ They were able to match speed with the _demon grinder_ and attacked the party, hoping to pick some of them off for an easy meal.

Oneshoe got in some good whacks with the _demon grinder's_ trusty wrecking ball, and Val kept the machine screaming on its course while firing off arrows. Horns made good use of a harpoon station, and Finn was a small ball of fury beside him whenever a _vrock_ got close. Grale did a lot of work to turn the tides of battle in the party's favor with his _stunning strikes;_ if the stun was successful, the _vrock_ would be unable to keep up with the warmachine and would just fall behind. One of the _vrocks_ managed to abduct Finn and started to fly away with her, but Horns summoned a flock of _giant owls_ and stole her back from the vulture-harpy.

Having escaped from or killed the _vrocks,_ the Menagerie kept on truckin'. They were able to earn a short rest while Val drove, and they spent some time inspecting the orb that Uldrak had given them. They discovered that it was an _orb of dragonkind;_ a powerful artifact, but very dangerous. The specifics of its abilities would have to wait for a proper _identity_ spell, but they could work out that a malign presence was contained within it, and that it would likely seek to overpower its wielder.

Meanwhile, Finn's _bag of devouring_ began convulsing and making rhythmic gagging noises, and before long it vomited forth a damp bundle of plant matter. Among those sticks and leaves and slime was another magic item that, after investigation, turned out to be a _wand of fear._ Soon thereafter, Arkhan's tower loomed up in the distance. A massive white dragon was circling the skies above it, and a host of creatures were just barely visible, shuffling along the tower's surrounding ramparts.
