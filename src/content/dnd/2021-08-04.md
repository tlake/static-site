## Summary

[Zed](/dnd/characters/zed/) receives news of the Feywild from an old friend before he is later served up as part of a "cake" buffet delivery to [Carmen](/dnd/characters/np-cs/carmen/). The party is approached with an offer of work to pay off [Carmen](/dnd/characters/np-cs/carmen/)'s hefty fee to defend [Horns](/dnd/characters/horns/), but it requires making another deal with a devil.

## Synopsis

### Recap

### Events

### News from the Feywild

- At The Brimstone, [Zed](/dnd/characters/zed/) is visited by an old acquaintance from the Summer Court, Cylin. 
- He shares that the power of the Summer Court is waning, [Queen Titania](/dnd/characters/np-cs/queen-titania/) is still out of commission, and [Oberon](/dnd/characters/np-cs/oberon/) has been leading the Wild Hunt without any sign of stopping.

### Carmen's Cake Buffet

- [Carmen](/dnd/characters/np-cs/carmen/) places a special order for a delivery of cake to her residence. She indulges in several "pieces" of cake, including [Zed](/dnd/characters/zed/).

### Ignaraz and Tymphal's Contract

- Back at The Brimstone, the party is met by a white spined devil who introduces herself as [Ignaraz](/dnd/characters/np-cs/ignaraz/).

- If the party agrees to take on the work, they will be bound by the terms of [Tymphal's Contract](/dnd/other-notes/tymphals-contract/).
