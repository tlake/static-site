### Description

#### Appearance

Gimble is a rock gnome standing just over three feet tall. He has blue eyes and chestnut hair which tends to be a frazzled mess, spiking upwards. He has a wide mustache and a trimmed goatee.

Gimble usually wears relatively simple clothing, such as the light tan, short robe customary to his duties as a librarian in his hometown.

#### Personality

Gimble usually tries to do good (as he sees it), but often the realities of adventuring do not leave easy choices. Since Gimble has a very cautious nature and is prone to overthinking options, this can lead to inaction. However, he will do what is necessary to help those in need.

### Biography

#### Background

Gimble seeks to unravel the mystery of a strange, blank book and its connection to his lost sister.

### Relationships

#### Finn the Conjurer

Early in the campaign, Gimble and [Finn](/dnd/characters/finn/) became friends. Curious at first, he was soon drawn in by her cheerful nature, and happily aided Finn with her studies in simple magic. Over time, Gimble developed more affection for Finn and showed signs that he wanted to help protect her from the fallout of the party's often (in his view) questionable decisions.

When [Gimble Became Lawful Evil in Avernus](/dnd/characters/gimble/gimble-became-lawful-evil-in-avernus/), he knew he had to escape the hellish plane and would no longer wait for the party to come to their senses. Still, his friendship with Finn made him waver. Gimble first made some [special castings](/dnd/characters/gimble/gimble-prepares-special-defensive-magic-for-finn/) into his *Ioun stone* and gave it to Finn, hoping it would help keep her safe. When Gimble finally confronted the party with his need to leave, he paused for a moment, saying "I'm sorry, Finn," before
banishing himself from the plane.

#### Gray

Gimble respects [Gray](/dnd/characters/haeltin-var-astora/). At several points, Gray and Gimble have entrusted each other to do the right thing when they couldn't fully trust themselves to do so. Gray asked Gimble to put him down if he ever lost control and attacked the party. Gimble entrusted Gray with the keeping of the *Plane Shift* scroll when he foresaw the possibility of [being corrupted in Avernus](/dnd/characters/gimble/gimble-became-lawful-evil-in-avernus/).

Gimble has also felt indebted to Gray for his sacrifices on behalf of Gimble in Leilon.

#### Horns

Gimble is often befuddled by [Horns](/dnd/characters/horns/).

#### OneShoe

Gimble is friends with [Oneshoe](/dnd/characters/oneshoe/). He admires her cunning and intelligence.

During the reconstruction of Tresandor Manor, the two gnomes enjoyed collaborating on the construction of a seven-foot-tall clockwork dragon.

After OneShoe had some difficulty during a fight with a witch, Gimble gave his *Necklace of Fireballs and Force* to OneShoe so that she would have more tools in future fights.

When Gimble sent a letter to the party in Phlegethos, he counted on Oneshoe's intellect to handle future coded messages.

#### Rinn'thalas

Gimble secretly arranged for [Rinn'thalas](/dnd/characters/rinnthalas-liadon/) to find and deliver a message to the party in the Hells. Gimble pulled in a favor with [Gorstag](/dnd/characters/gorstag/) to accomplish this. Rinn'thalas is not aware of Gimble's involvement.

#### Val

Gimble currently fears and distrusts [Val](/dnd/characters/val/).

Early in the campaign, Gimble and Val were friendly, but their relationship soon became strained. After her rescue from captivity from the Orcs at Wyvern Tor, Val started displaying more impulsive and violent behavior which often put the party at risk. At times, her actions were straight evil, and to Gimble's consternation, the party usually tacitly allowed or even outright defended Val's actions.

Then there was [That time Val tried to murder Gimble](/dnd/characters/gimble/that-time-val-tried-to-murder-gimble/).

And yet, despite the above, Gimble felt compelled to save Val first instead of his newly-found family during the [Dilemma at the Aboleth's Lair](/dnd/characters/gimble/dilemma-at-the-aboleths-lair/). This choice later weighed upon him heavily.

When [Gimble Became Lawful Evil in Avernus](/dnd/characters/gimble/gimble-became-lawful-evil-in-avernus/), he was released from any latent feeling of obligation or camaraderie towards Val.

#### Zed

Gimble is friendly with [Zed](/dnd/characters/zed/) and has found him to be a trusted companion; however, part of Gimble still finds the paladin a bit of a mystery and remains somewhat wary of him.

A study in contrasts, Zed's massive size and physical prowess alone would intimidate most any folk of Gimble's stature. Yet, Zed also possesses a gentle nature and forthrightness which mostly allay those fears. However, when Gimble was preyed on by a Night Hag in the Feydark, the creature tormented Gimble with visions of a nightmarish Zed slaughtering the party. Though the hag and her nightmares are no more, and, rationally, Gimble has dismissed the visions as merely cruel tricks of the mind, he hasn't quite been able to shake the dread from that incident.

This certainly hasn't been helped by the trip to Avernus, during which Zed gleefully rode astride a giant, *Nightmare*-form of Bullwinkle.
