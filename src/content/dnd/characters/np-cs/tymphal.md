A duke of Phlegethos, Tymphal was a mechanical master smith whose lesser devil legions and hundreds of duergar slaves toiled in a volcano forge to produce weapons and infernal constructs.

## Key Info

- According to [Ignaraz](/dnd/characters/np-cs/ignaraz/), Tymphal lost one of his chief engineers, a duegar named [Magrin](/dnd/characters/np-cs/magrin/). He has apparently been abducted to [Fierna](/dnd/characters/np-cs/fierna/)'s tower. Without [Magrin](/dnd/characters/np-cs/magrin/), Tymphal's operation has lost much of its operational efficiency.
- Through Ignaraz, the party is employed by [Tymphal's Contract](/dnd/other-notes/tymphals-contract/) to collect Magrin from his captivity in the Caper at Fierna's Tower.

## Relationships

### Fierna

Tymphal is not thought to be a fan of [Fierna](/dnd/characters/np-cs/fierna/), and so he tends to isolate himself in his forge.

### Magrin

Tymphal apparently relies upon Magrin greatly for the overall success of his operations.
