## Key Info

- According to [Tymphal](/dnd/characters/np-cs/tymphal/), Magrin was abducted by [Fierna](/dnd/characters/np-cs/fierna/), and without him, Tymphal's operations are flailing. This is the basis of the work in [Tymphal's Contract](/dnd/other-notes/tymphals-contract/).
- However, in 2021-12-22 Import Campaign#The Library, [Oneshoe](/dnd/characters/oneshoe/) finds a contract between [Fierna](/dnd/characters/np-cs/fierna/) and [Magrin](/dnd/characters/np-cs/magrin/) which implies it was a consensual arrangement.
