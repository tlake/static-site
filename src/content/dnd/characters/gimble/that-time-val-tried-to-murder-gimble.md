## That time Val tried to murder Gimble

When the party became 5th level, [Gimble](/dnd/characters/gimble-the-diviner) had a premonition that he would very soon need the ability to fly. Obsessed with this, he absentmindedly plucked a feather from [Val](/dnd/characters/val)'s new *Giant Owl* form for a spell component to aid in his furious study. Although he did not notice at first, Val was enraged.

When the party took flight on the backs of the druids' new flying forms, Val decided to try to murder Gimble by knocking him off Owl-[Horns](/dnd/characters/horns)' back mid-flight. Gimble's premonition came true, and he cast *Fly*, saving himself from careening to his death.

Val was unrepentant and claimed her actions were justified due to the insult of the removed feather. Gimble was aghast. When the rest of the party tried to deescalate by saying both Gimble and Val had done wrong, Gimble could not believe it. He was done. For the first time, Gimble used *Dimension Door* to teleport as far away from the party as he could. [Gray](/dnd/characters/haeltin-var-astora) tracked and caught up with Gimble and tried to persuade him to return to the group. But Gimble was defiant. He would not travel any further with Val that day.
