[Gimble the Diviner](/dnd/characters/gimble-the-diviner/)

## Gimble prepares special defensive magic for Finn

When [Gimble Became Lawful Evil in Avernus](/dnd/characters/gimble/gimble-became-lawful-evil-in-avernus/), he new he had to leave the Hells. However, his lingering friendship with [Finn](/dnd/characters/finn/) compelled him to first make some special castings into his *Ioun stone* and give it to [Finn](/dnd/characters/finn/), hoping it would help keep her safe.

### Details

Before retiring for long rest, [Gimble](/dnd/characters/gimble-the-diviner/) will cast the following spells into the *Ioun Stone* and present it to [Finn](/dnd/characters/finn/).

- *Absorb Elements*
- *Shield*
- *Feather Fall*

These are all reaction spells. Considering Finn, I think it would be fun if these spells auto-activated when warranted, surprising her in the process (though still consuming a reaction).

#### Unconfirmed Bonus

Pending DM ruling:

- It would be uber-cool if somehow Gimble found a way for those spells to recharge each day unless they are overridden by other castings into the stone, but that would be beyond normal capabilities of the item/spells.
