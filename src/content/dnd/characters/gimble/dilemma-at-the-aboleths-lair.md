[Gimble the Diviner](/dnd/characters/gimble-the-diviner)

## Dilemma at the Aboleth's Lair

In Shadow Leilon, [Gimble](/dnd/characters/gimble-the-diviner) was finally able to locate his missing sister and aunt in the depths of the aboleth's lair in [2019-08-09 Import Campaign](/dnd/posts/2019-08-09). [Nyx](/dnd/npcs/nyx) and Lyra were found unmoving and encased in a large crystal. When [Gimble](/dnd/characters/gimble-the-diviner) failed to extricate them from their apparent prison, the aboleth returned and attacked the party.

After a lengthy battle, there was a moment in time when the aboleth appeared to land a critical blow upon Gimble. Just then, the crystal shattered, [Nyx](/dnd/npcs/nyx) put her hand out, and the events changed, with the devastating attack missing Gimble instead. His sister had saved him, but with the crystal sanctum broken, both Nyx and Lyra seemed doomed to drown without quick intervention.

At the same time, a heavily wounded [Val](/dnd/characters/val) was beset on all sides by the remaining powerful servitors of the aboleth, and things look grim for the druid.

Gimble only had time to save [Val](/dnd/characters/val) or his newfound family, but not both.

Gimble chose Val.

After some quick mental calculations, Gimble enveloped Val in *Otiluke's Resilient Sphere*, proof against any attack, and he called out to [Horns](/dnd/characters/horns) to cast *Water Breathing* on his family.

In the end, all three were saved. But, the fact that Gimble chose [Val](/dnd/characters/val), of all people, over the safety of his family soon began to weigh on him greatly.
