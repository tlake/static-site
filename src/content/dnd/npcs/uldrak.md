## Biography

The empyrean Uldrak quested into [the Nine Hells](/dnd/locations/the-nine-hells-of-baator) to slay [Tiamat](/dnd/npcs/tiamat) and win glory for his deity, Surtur, but he was beaten handily by the dragon queen. The empyrean wasn’t slain; instead, Tiamat cursed him for his impudence by transforming him into a spined devil. The Menagerie found him hiding inside the helmet that he once wore — for millennia, Uldrak has dwelled in this spot, forlornly plotting to restore his true form.

His curse was to remain in the wretched form until he was able to "spill Tiamat's blood on the ground," so in order to restore him to his former glory, the Menagerie went in search of Tiamat's blood.
