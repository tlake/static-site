## Description

A _narzugon_ that the Menagerie encountered in [Avernus](/dnd/locations/avernus), the first layer of [the Nine Hells of Baator](/dnd/locations/baator).

### Appearance

### Personality

## Biography

He had been one of [Zariel's](/dnd/npcs/zariel) generals in the time before her fall, and when her host crashed and broke upon the infernal legions, Haruman took it upon himself to deliver judgement upon those of the host who deserted the cause. In the eons since, Avernus has warped and bolstered Haruman; what once was a being of strength and righteousness has been burned away, leaving only a fiendish arbiter of his own justice.
