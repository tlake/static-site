[Import Campaign Characters](/dnd/characters/)

## Tymphal

A duke of Phlegethos, Tymphal was a mechanical master smith whose lesser devil legions and hundreds of duergar slaves toiled in a volcano forge to produce weapons and infernal constructs.

### Description

#### Appearance

An immense, imposing figure--a sort of mixture of golem and fiend. He sports a pair of enormous wings, but his great bulk makes it seem improbably that they could actually carry him aloft.

#### Personality

Absorbed in coordinating his operations, Tymphal seemingly thought the party was beneath his interest and did not deign to speak to them directly.

### Biography

### Key Info

- According to [Ignaroz](/dnd/npcs/ignaroz), Tymphal lost one of his chief engineers, a duegar named [Magrin](/dnd/npcs/magrin). He has apparently been abducted to [Fierna](/dnd/npcs/fierna)'s tower. Without Magrin, Tymphal's operation has lost much of its operational efficiency.
- Through Ignaroz, the party is employed by [Tymphal's Contract](/dnd/notes/tymphals-contract) to collect Magrin from his captivity in the Caper at Fierna's Tower.

### Relationships

#### Fierna

Tymphal is not thought to be a fan of Fierna, and so he tends to isolate himself in his forge.

#### Magrin

- Tymphal apparently ~~relies~~ relied upon Magrin greatly for the overall success of his operations.
- After the revelation that Magrin went willing to Fierna, Tymphal was swift with punishing the disloyalty of the dwarf.
