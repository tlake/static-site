Creed Trilby, Lord of the Edge, Vassal of Bel helped The Menagerie one by one onto his boat, the _Pearljammer._
The vessel was larger than the typical _merrenoloth_ crafts, but it definitely looked shoddier.
It resembled a ramshackle river boat, wide and shallow, its rusty hull sitting low in the water.
A steering lever protruded from the patchwork wooden deck near the bow of the boat, and a long pole lay along the side of the deck.

Creed brought out a pair of well-used deck chairs from the cabin and set them up on the deck, inviting up to two of the Menagerie to take seats.
After getting the vessel underway, he began to engage the group in fairly idle conversation, asking them things like the purpose of their visit.
For a while, the party was willing to chat, and they asked him some questions about his time in the Nine Hells.
It turned out that although he didn't know the Jefferson who ran the nightclub in Neverwinter, Jefferson is apparently a not uncommon name in the Hells.

The party spent a bit of time telling them about themselves.
At one point, Finn brought out a memento from her family: an old, empty wine bottle that she's been carrying around for a couple of years.
Grey was visibly surprised, and mentioned that he recognized the bottle and the label from a time in his past, when he was spending most of his days losing himself in bottles just like Finn's.

When asked about their destination, Abriymoch, Creed explained that it was a city that never sleeps, and is awash with all kinds of entertainment - taverns, theatre, casinos, dens of iniquity, and, of course, courts of law.
Through talk about the casinos, Creed _did_ reveal that he knew of the Baron, the party's part-time compatriot, Gorstag.
Apparently the Baron has amassed some amount of fame here in Baator, and at least an equal part of infamy as well.

They also inquired about what Horns might be able to expect from his trial.
Creed mentioned that Horns would certainly be able to represent himself, or that he could perhaps search the city for a legal representative.
He'd likely have no trouble in finding one, but their caliber would no doubt be directly tied to their price.
A decent defendant would probably require several dozen soul coins, or several tens of thousands of gold pieces.
Alternative forms of exchange might also be possible, including quid pro quo, signing over years of life, or post-mortem soul contracts.

It wasn't long before Creed brought out his knife collection to show off in agonizing detail.
The majority of his knives were elaborately over-wrought, looking very cool while being actually pretty useless to wield in real combat.
He made a point to demonstrate several stances, grips, and flashy techniques; while cool folks like the Menagerie were out partying it up with dwarves and devils and what-have-you, Creed Trilby was studying the blade.

It became apparent that there was much of the Styx to traverse before they even reached the first descent.
Partially to recuperate from their investigation of the wrecked flying fortress, and partially to stop listening to the endless posturing of their edgelord guide, the group decided to bunker down for a rest.
OneShoe took the only bed in the cabin, a couple others took floor space in the cabin, and the rest had to lay their bedrolls out on the deck.
Creed Trilby took the chance to show off the arcane shipboard musical feature he'd cobbled together from wrecked flying fortress scrap, and a song very much like but legally different from _"With Arms Wide Open"_ issued forth.

It played on repeat.

Dreams came to some.
In particular, Grey dreamt that he was dangling his hand in the river Styx.
From the waters an alabaster-white hand gripped his arm and pulled him down into their depths, the crimson shifting to darkness as he was dragged deeped and deeper.
When all was black, a familiar porcelain face emerged.
Grey asked what she wanted this time, and the Raven Queen instead said that she was merely facilitating a meeting.
Stars blinked on across the dark backdrop, and a constellation in the shape of a wolf animated.
The hulking celestial form of the Nameless Wolf stalked over to Grey and butted its head up against Grey's chest.
A thrumming pressure built up within Grey, and he noticed that Finn and Not-Bailey were in the dream beside him.
He took Finn's hand, and the energy transferred to her; likewise, she patted Not-Bailey on the head and transferred the Nameless Wolf's gift to her.
One by one the stars winked out, leaving all in blackness as the dream faded.

> _[ **Mechanical Note:** This marks a change in Not-Bailey's statistics._
> _Going forward we can use the sidekick rules as laid forth in Tasha's Cauldron of Everything for Not-Bailey! ]_

The party awoke after a successful rest (OneShoe woke up feeling a little greasier than normal, having slept in Creed's bed).
