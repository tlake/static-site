The _imp_ Balakros conjured a small chair and lounged upon the middle platform near the jackal-fiend, and the Menagerie approached the tortuous structure. OneShoe, being in the lead, slowed in her advance as the voice of the _sibriex_ - somehow both simpering and gutteral - slipped into her mind. Through telepathy it praised and lauded her, and beseeched her to free it. OneShoe replied through the telepathy that she and her friends were here for information, and when the _sibriex_ asked her to indicate who her friends were so it could open up a telepathic party line between them all, OneShoe gestured to all of the Menagerie except for Horns.

Meanwhile, Horns (flying) and Val (climbing) made their way to the platform halfway up the scaffolding. Upon closer inspection, the jackal-fiend could be seen wearing a spellbook bound in _chasme_ flesh at his waist, and could be heard addressing the _sibriex_ in a very slow, simplistic manner, as if he were addressing a particularly unintelligent child. Horns and Val told the jackal-fiend (which Horns managed to identify as an _arcanaloth_) that they were to extract some information from the _sibriex_ under the orders of Bel, and the _arcanaloth_ offered them a couple of _soul coins_ if they could make the being talk.

While the rest of the group were drawn into the telepathy, Horns engaged the _arcanaloth_ in conversation. Apparently in recent months, the demon had grown more and more recalcitrant, and it was an increasingly arduous ordeal to convince it to part with even the smallest scrap of information.



then the sibriex telepathically told the party that it would tell them whatever they wanted to know if they freed it

so val surprise-attacked the arcanaloth

in retribution, the arcanaloth cast chain lightning on the group, catching also their imp guide (the arcanaloth viewed the imp as a traitor because it had spoken on the group's behalf) in the blast and vaporizing it to permadeath instantly

it also hit val with a finger of death spell, and she was only saved because she was a wild-shaped druid and her animal form could tank enough of the damage so that the overflow damage didn't kill her (finger of death would have reanimated her as a zombie under the arcanaloth's control if the spell killed her)

and it counterspelled one of her castings of blight

through a combination of reducing it to low hp and affecting it with some fear effects, the arcanaloth dimension doored 500 ft away and then went invisible

one of the chain devils was killed, and a deal was struck with the other one where they would let it leave alive as long as it didn't tell anybody what happened here for as long as it lived

the sibriex had told the group that it would tell them where the rods were if they freed it; the group agreed, the sibriex told them that the rods were in a wrecked flying fortress, and then the group decided not to free it and instead try to extract more information from it

the sibriex clammed up, the group told them that they would come back and free it if it told them the location of the fortress, and it cited the group's negligence to free it after it told them where the rods were as a reason why they couldn't be trusted, and refused to cooperate until they freed it

val and oneshoe figured that the group had enough to go on that they could probably track down the fortress through alternative investigative means, and went back to the car

horns was convinced by the sibriex that freeing it was the best way to get a lot more information, and so he tried to start breaking the chains

grey tried to stop him, and then the sibriex telepathically told horns that it could stop grey from interfering if horns wanted, and then horns could free the sibriex and the sibriex would tell horns everything that he wanted to know

horns agreed, and we ended the session with grey failing a DC 21 int save against the sibriex's feeblemind spell
