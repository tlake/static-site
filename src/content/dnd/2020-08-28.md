Horns kicked things off by picking up the _horned devil's_ military fork (functionally, a _hellfire pike_), and memories of wielding such weapons rushed to his mind. He felt his armor growing tighter, as if it were shrinking, but the magical equipment was able to adapt its fit to accomodate the new pair of leathery bat wings that were growing from Horns' middle back, below his shoulder blades. They finished growing within minutes, and Horns immediately took the skies to practice and become comfortable with his new appendages.

The drow Cassandra Belacourt requested a ride back to the crumpled wreckage of the _scavenger_ where she recovered the payment that she had used to secure the aid of the now-defeated warband: three _soul coins._ She requested once more that the party help her get to the Bone Brambles, and they offered to take her there themselves after they managed to free a unicorn. She felt that her own mission was urgent enough to avoid such a delay if possible, and instead offered to buy one of the two _devil's rides_ from the group for the same three _soul coins_ that she had given to the warband. The group seemed amenable to the idea, and happily sold her the motorcycle that Grey hadn't claimed.

Grale (who had also joined the ranks of folks who woke up on the evil side of the bed) conjured up a _minor illusion_ to show her the destination of Red Ruth's hut so she could navigate there, then asked what that information was worth; she replied that she'd consider it a fair exchange for the potion she gave to Gimble. The Menagerie wanted to know more about this mouth (and its entity) that Cassandra was hunting down, and failed to conceal their own intentions - Finn mentioned something about the mouth being a bag, Grale unsuccessfully tried to snatch the _bag of devouring_ from her, and Oneshoe just straight-up blurted out that she'd stuck her hand inside it.

Now that she understood that the bag was in The Menagerie's possession, Cassandra wanted to acquire it from them so she could store it in a secure location - probably not the great library at Candlekeep this time. The Menagerie offered her a deal: if she accompanied and helped them out until such time as they were able to free the unicorn at the Demon Zapper, then they would hand over the _bag of devouring._ Preferring to complete her reclamations without unnecessary violence, Cassandra agreed, and Grale passed some time talking with her about the Order of the Shadowstalker Monks.

The group made their way towards Arkhan's tower (Finn and Horns tried unsuccessfully to communicate with the being attached to the mouth of the _bag of devouring_), and Zed took over the helm from Bullwinkle in order to bring the Anti-Chrysler to a stop in front of the twenty-by-twenty-feet gates of the ramparts. The ramparts themselves were about fifty feet tall, and forty feet deep. Val approached the gates, the great white dragon landed upon the top of the tower to watch the group intently, and one of the undead atop the ramparts slumped over the edge and called down, "whoooooo?"

Zed informed the zombie that The Menagerie was here to see Arkhan, and the figure disappeared back over the ramparts. Several minutes later, a small steel plate set into a more-reasonably-sized door within the greater gate door slid open and revealed a grey, weathered, reptilian face. The creature demanded to know the identity and business of the visitors, and Val was unwilling to disclose any information. After some stalemate back-and-forth, the reptilian creature just closed the metal plate again, being of the opinion that if the group wasn't willing to cooperate then they could get bent. Zed regained the creature's attention, and introduced Val as Oneshoe.

The steel plate slid back open, and the creature introduced itself as Krull. The Menagerie eventually managed to convery that they were looking for Arkhan because they wanted to trade an _orb of dragonkind,_ and Krull was convinced that this was significant enough to merit that he should lead the group to Arkhan. Another few minutes later, Krull - a weathered tortle wielding a skullish mace and whose spiky shell was covered with carved draconic runes - flew over the ramparts riding on a blue dragon named Vistalancer, and took a moment to order an undead to throw itself down from the ramparts. He prodded the crumpled heap of zombie back to its feet, positioned it in front of the gate, and hung an "Out To Lunch" sign around its neck, then remounted the dragon and bade the party to follow.

Krull led the party across Avernus and through a twisting, maze-like geography of trails that wound between severe, towering plateaus. After navigating this terrain, the land before them stretched out in an immense, shallowly-sloping bowl shape, littered with more detritus, and bones the size of houses. At the far end of this gradual descent rested an enormous dragon's skull, jutting out from a giant mountain. Near the skull, nestled among the gargantuan bones stood a military tent, guarded by almost a dozen white, reptilian, winged creatures with gleaming blades. Krull told the party to wait here while he convinced Arkhan and his coterie to not kill them outright, and he flew off to the tent.
While he went inside, Vistalancer took the opportunity to lay down, curving around three sides of the tent.
