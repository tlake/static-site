I'm originally from Vermont, but I make my home in Seattle where I drink coffee, make puns, and play D&D.

I enjoy writing Terraform configurations and CI/CD pipelines, and I believe in infrastructure as code.

I trend towards backend work where I primarily use Golang and Python, but I'll dip into React from time to time.
