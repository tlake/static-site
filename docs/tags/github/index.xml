      <description>I&amp;rsquo;d been reading up about git-secret and realized that I didn&amp;rsquo;t really grasp what a PGP key is or how to use one (or more). I&amp;rsquo;ve had a Keybase account since 2011, and it&amp;rsquo;s become a bit of a disjointed mess. The addition and revocation of devices makes sense, since I&amp;rsquo;ve gone through a couple of phones since 2011. However, my usage of PGP keys has been erratic.
You see, my nebulous grasp of PGP keys roughly equated them with SSH keys, and so I&amp;rsquo;d created and revoked a few of them.</description>

      <description>Porkbun is my new favorite domain registrar and had the best deals on .io domains that I could find, but I wanted to use DNSimple to manage my DNS settings. DNSimple offers a robust API and a Terraform provider, which is very appealing to my infrastructure-as-code aspirations. Luckily, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty easy to get the best of both worlds:
 Through Porkbun, replace the domain&amp;rsquo;s default nameservers with DNSimple&amp;rsquo;s nameservers.
 Import the domain through DNSimple and bam!</description>
