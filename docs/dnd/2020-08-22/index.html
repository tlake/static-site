  <div

<p>The Menagerie&rsquo;s next goal was visible on the horizon: behind obsidian ramparts stood Arkhan&rsquo;s tower, an obelisk capped with five large spikes, evidently defended by the great white dragon soaring lazily above it. Between the party and the tower stretched a cluttered expanse of slagged metal, jagged stone, and broken bones; likely the effects of a region claimed and hunted by dragons. Huge crags stabbed out from the ground, many leaning at severe angles and featuring furrowed earth that hinted at a history when the rock might have been used by some gargantuan creature as projectiles.</p>
<p>Gimble took a few minutes to cast <em>identify</em> on the <em>orb of dragonkind,</em> and was able to glean the particulars of its attunement: it would grant +1 AC, remove its wielder&rsquo;s ability to smell, provide protection against being <em>charmed</em> or <em>frightened,</em> and deal a boatload of psychic damage to its attunee. Thereafter, the <em>orb</em> itself would attempt to assert its malignant charisma over its wielder, but it would also grant access to some spells and the ability to compel evil dragons within 40 miles to travel to the <em>orb.</em></p>
<p>Nobody decided to attune to it.</p>
<p>With still more travel ahead of them and no certainty that the tower&rsquo;s guardian dragon (to say nothing of any other inhabiting creatures) would be friendly, the Menagerie felt it smartest to try and rest instead of charging in exhausted and depleted. Some scouting by Luna showed a couple of options: to their left was a small canyon, and to their right was a particularly suitable crag. If they set up camp in the canyon, they would be visible to creatures the air looking down, but not to creatures on the ground looking around. If they camped underneath the looming crag, they could be seen by creatures on the ground looking around, but would be shielded from creatures above. Gimble argued that the threat of a dragon was probably the greatest, and so they drove towards the shelter provided by the crook of the crag.</p>
<p>As the party approached their would-be campsite, they discovered it already occupied by a small cooking fire and their plane-hopping friend, Gorstag. He of course invited them to share the space, and Gimble set up another <em>tiny hut</em> at the base of the crag. Gorstag and Zed took the first watch, and beyond sharing puns and yoga poses, nothing in particular happened within the camp. Finn, Grey, and Not-Bailey took over for the middle watch, and another rain of blood began to fall; more gentle this time than the last.</p>
<p>Finn went out to dance in it while Not-Bailey watched from just inside the crag. Grey kept an ear out for trouble, and grew suspicious when he heard and saw the rain stop; the droplets were frozen mid-fall, and so was everything else. Finn had stopped in the middle of a skip, and the flame of the cooking fire was held in stasis. Only Grey - and, peculiarly, Not-Bailey - were able to move. A chill at the nape of Grey&rsquo;s neck drew his attention to a small, pale light glowing from within the shadows of the darkest part of the crag, where it met the furrow in the ground. He walked towards it, and it seemed that either the light and shadows were growing around him, or he was shrinking.</p>
<p>The pale glow, expanding in size as he walked closer, soon resolved into the image of a porcelain face, and a matching porcelain hand appeared from the darkness. Resting upon the upturned palm was an origami crane, and the Raven Queen spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I intercepted this for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grey took it, opened up to inspect it, and saw the note that he had written the night before they had left the Material Plane; <em>&ldquo;When it rains, it hails.&quot;</em> She asked him how certain he was that the intended recipient was still trustworthy, and if he was sure that it was a good idea to reveal his continued existence to her. Grey thought about it for a moment, then tucked the crane into a pocket. He wondered why it was that the Raven Queen was able to come to him now, in this place, and she said that some weather is more conducive to travel than others.</p>
<p>She then told him that the more important reason for her visit was to deliver a warning. She cautioned Grey to stay out of the Feywild, for Oberon was gathering the Wild Hunt.</p>
<p>Grey managed to thank the Raven Queen, and she accepted his gratitude with a barely-perceptible nod before withdrawing and fading back into the inky darkness. Grey turned to leave with Not-Bailey, who received a couple of head pats from something in those shadows. As they emegerged from that pocket of divinity back into the shelter of the crag, time returned to its normal flow, and Finn continued to dance in the blood.</p>
<p>Horns took point on the final watch, and the rest concluded successfully. As the group stretched and came together and broke their fast, several of them felt less charitable than they usually do; Gimble, Grey, and Gorstag seem to have undergone the same subtle, evil shift in personality that Finn has.</p>
<p>This time, Zed wanted to learn how to drive the Anti-Chrysler, and got so caught up in doing so that he didn&rsquo;t notice a warband moving in behind them until a harpoon sheared its way into the helm. The party got to battle stations in readiness against the warband:</p>
<ul>
<li>on a <em>tormentor</em> were a <em>horned devil</em> and two <em>hobgoblins;</em></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><img src="/images/dnd/monster-bitter-breath.png" alt="the horned devil &ldquo;bitter breath&rdquo;"></p>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>on a <em>scavenger</em> were a <em>hobgoblin captain</em>, two <em>hobgoblins,</em> and a drow;</li>
<li>and two <em>hobgoblin captains</em> each drove <em>devil&rsquo;s rides.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The two <em>devil&rsquo;s rides,</em> hell-on-wheels that they are, were able to close distance pretty rapidly and drew up along either side of the Anti-Chrysler. The two larger vehicles were also gaining on the Menagerie, but at a slower rate. More harpoons rained down upon the group, and the <em>horned devil</em> hurled balls of flame. Some dissention in the ranks was visible upon the <em>scavenger;</em> the <em>hobgoblin captain</em> barked orders at the drow, and she refused to follow whatever they were.</p>
<p>Aboard the Anti-Chrysler, Gorstag got a taste of heavy weaponry by manning a harpoon launcher, and Finn started dual-wielding magic wands; first the <em>wand of fear,</em> and then the <em>wand of magic missiles.</em> Horns summoned a handful of <em>mud mephits</em> onto the enemy vehicles, while Zed took the opportunity to teach Bullwinkle-the-Nightmare how to drive. Gimble quickly recalled the old adage about immovable objects, and cast a <em>wall of force</em> fifty feet wide and twenty feet tall in the Anti-Chrysler&rsquo;s wake. Both the <em>tormentor</em> and the <em>scavenger</em> charged haplessly into it and came to a sudden and violent halt. The <em>tormentor</em> had a much more substantial crumple zone than the <em>scavenger,</em> but in either case, the vehicles' occupants were all launched from their positions. With the exception of the <em>horned devil,</em> who unfolded a pair of wings in time, and the drow, who was quick enough to cast <em>feather fall</em> on herself, the occupants of the vehicles all collided with the <em>wall of force</em> in a gory, muddy smear.</p>
<p>The <em>horned devil,</em> borne aloft by wings instead of a warmachine, closed distance with the Anti-Chrysler, intent on getting revenge on Gimble. Grey transformed into his hybrid boi form, and slapped a <em>blood curse</em> upon the <em>horned devil.</em> Zed had Bullwinkle take the wheel to drive the <em>demon grinder</em> closer to one of the <em>devil&rsquo;s rides</em> while he <em>channeled divinity,</em> and once he was in range, he caused entangling vines to reach up and snatch the <em>hobgoblin captain</em> off of the machine. Zed then <em>misty stepped</em> onto the motorcycle, accompanied by one of Horns' two remaining <em>mud mephits.</em></p>
<p>The <em>horned devil</em> laid into Gimble something fierce, even getting attacks around the plane of his <em>shield</em> spell, and inflicted an infernal wound upon the gnome. Grey&rsquo;s <em>blood curse</em> played merry havoc upon the <em>horned devil&rsquo;s</em> internals with the exertion required for its flurry of attacks, and Gimble put his <em>animate objects</em> trick to good use this time; ten silvered darts fluttered to life and began stinging the <em>horned devil</em> like a small swarm of bees.</p>
<p>Horns became an <em>air elemental</em> and cycloned the last remaining <em>hobgoblin captain</em> off of the other <em>devil&rsquo;s ride,</em> and Grey took a running leap off of the Anti-Chrysler and did an anime-AF flip midair and landed in the vacated seat to take control of the warmachine. Then, a hellish doorway opened onto the top of the <em>demon grinder</em> and the drow stepped through the <em>dimension door.</em> She immeidately made it known that she meant the Menagerie no ill will, and when asked to prove it, she took up an offensive spellcasting stance against the <em>horned devil.</em></p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t have the time to act, however, as the group focused all their efforts on taking out the fiend. Oneshoe brought the wrecking ball to bear, Gorstag flung more harpoons, and Finn and Gimble kept up the assault of their <em>magic missiles</em> and <em>animated objects.</em> Zed and Grey peeled off from beside the <em>demon grinder</em> and closed in beneath the <em>horned devil.</em> Zed was able to stab upward with Lancelot by standing on the seat of the <em>devil&rsquo;s ride,</em> but Grey didn&rsquo;t have the extended reach that a lance provides. To compensate, he pulled the nose of the warmachine up into a badass wheelie&hellip; but then it kept going, and the motorcycle-riding werewolf wiped out and ate Avernian dirt. Growling, he picked himself and the warmachine up, kicked it back into gear, and tried again - and <em>this</em> time he looked super cool as he screamed in busting a mad wheelie with wolf tattoos aglow, and he landed a blow on the <em>horned devil</em> with his blade that trailed an afterimage of a starry night sky.</p>
<p>The <em>horned devil</em> discorporated in a cloud of smoke and sulfur, and the drow hurried to administer a <em>potion of healing</em> to Gimble who was very quickly bleeding out from his infernal wound. As the situation calmed down, she introduced herself as Cassandra Belacourt, an agent of The Reclamation - an organization that tracks down dangerous artifacts that have been lost or stolen and returns them to places of safekeeping.</p>
<p>She asked the party if they knew how to get to the Bone Brambles, and if they could either take her there themselves or at least tell her how to find them. She had chartered the warband as an escort, but that plan went up in flames once they decided to attack the Menagerie. Gimble asked what she was currently seeking, and she said that it was a little odd to describe. She was tracking down an interplanar criminal, sort of. The criminal itself is bound and contained, but it has a strange physiology; around ten years ago, its mouth was stolen from the vaults of the great library of Candlekeep, and the thief fled from the Material Plane. The last known location of this thief was Avernus, and Cassandra&rsquo;s investigations have turned up that the thief had traveled to the Bone Brambles.</p>
